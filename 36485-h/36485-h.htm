<h3>KATHERINE TO THE WINNEBAGOS</h3>
<p><span class="date">Oct. 1, 19&mdash;.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Dear First-And-Onlys:</span></p>
<p>When I got to the post-office to-day and found
there was no letter from you, my heart sank right
through the bottom of my number seven boots and
buried itself in the mud under the doorsill. All day
long I had had a feeling that there would be a letter,
and that hope kept me up nobly through the trying
ordeal of attempting to teach spelling and geography
and arithmetic to a roomful of children of
assorted ages who seem as determined not to learn
as I am determined to teach them. It sustained and
soothed me through the exciting process of &ldquo;settling&rdquo;
Absalom Butts, the fourteen-year-old bully
of the class, with whom I have a preliminary skirmish
every day in the week before recitations can
begin; and through the equally trying business of
listening to his dull-witted sister, Clarissa, spell &ldquo;example&rdquo;
forty ways but the right way, and then dissolve
into inevitable tears. When school was out I
was as limp as a rag, and so thankful it was Friday
night that I could have kissed the calendar. I fairly
&ldquo;sic&rdquo;ed Sandhelo along the road to the post-office,
expecting to revel in the bale of news from my belov&eacute;ds
that was awaiting me, but when I got there
and the post box was bare the last button burst off
the mantle of my philosophy and left me naked to
the cold winds of disappointment. A whole orphan
asylum with the mumps on both sides would have
been gay and chipper compared to me when I
turned Sandhelo&rsquo;s head homeward and started on
the six-mile drive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>It had been raining for more than a week, a
steady, warmish, sickening drizzle, that had taken
all the curl out of my spirits and left them hanging
in dejected, stringy wisps. I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling
how well the weather matched my state of mind as
I drove homeward. The whole landscape was one
gray blur, and the tall weeds that bordered the road
on both sides wept unconsolably on each other&rsquo;s
shoulders, their tears mingling in a stream down
their stems. I could almost hear them sob. The
muddy yellow road wound endlessly past empty,
barren fields, and seemed to hold out no promise of
ever arriving anywhere in particular. All my life
I have hated that aimlessly winding road, just as I
have always hated those empty, barren fields. They
have always seemed so shiftless, so utterly unambitious.
I can&rsquo;t help thinking that this corner of
Arkansas was made out of the scraps that were
left after everything else was finished. How father
ever came to take up land here when he had the
whole state to choose from is one of the seven things
we will never know till the coming of the Cocqcigrues.
It&rsquo;s as flat as a pancake, and, for the most
part, treeless. The few trees there are seem to be
ashamed to be caught growing in such a place, and
make themselves as small as possible. The land is
stony and barren and sterile, neither very good for
farming or grazing. The only certain thing about
the rainfall is that it is certain to come at the wrong
time, and upset all your plans. &ldquo;Principal rivers,
there are none; principal mountains&mdash;I&rsquo;m the only
one,&rdquo; as Alice-in-Wonderland used to say. But
father has always been the kind of man that gets
the worst of every bargain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>Now, you unvaryingly cheerful Winnebagos, go
ahead and sniff contemptuously when you breathe
the damp vapors rising from this epistle, and hear
the pitiful moans issuing therefrom. &ldquo;For shame,
Katherine!&rdquo; I can hear you saying, in superior tones,
&ldquo;to get low in your mind so soon! Why, you
haven&rsquo;t come to the first turn in the Open Road, and
you&rsquo;ve gone lame already. Where is the Torch that
you started out with so gaily flaring? Quenched
completely by the first shower! Katherine Adams,
you big baby, straighten up your face this minute
and stop blubbering!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>But oh, you round pegs in your nice smooth,
round holes, you have never been a stranger in a
familiar land! You have never known what it was
to be out of tune with everything around you. Oh,
why wasn&rsquo;t I built to admire vast stretches of nothing,
content to dwell among untrodden ways and
be a Maid whom there were none to praise and very
few to love, and all that Wordsworth business?
Why do crickets and grasshoppers and owls make
me feel as though I&rsquo;d lost my last friend, instead of
impressing me with the sociability of Nature? Why
don&rsquo;t I rejoice that I&rsquo;ve got the whole road to myself,
instead of wishing that it were jammed with
automobiles and trolley cars, and swarming with
people? Why did Fate set me down on a backwoods
farm when my only desire in life is to dwell in a
house by the side of the road where the circus parade
of life is continually passing? Why am I not
like the other people in this section, with whom ignorance
is bliss, grammar an unknown quantity, and
culture a thing to be sneered at?</p>
<p>Although I can&rsquo;t see them, I know that somewhere
to the north, just beyond the horizon, the
mountains lift their great frowning heads, and ever
since I can remember I have looked upon them as a
fence which shut me out from the big bustling world,
and over which I would climb some day. Just as
Napoleon said, &ldquo;Beyond the Alps lies Italy,&rdquo; so I
thought, &ldquo;Beyond the Ozarks lies my world.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe I had my nose out of a book for
half an hour at a time in those early days. I went
without new clothes to buy them, and got up early
and worked late to get my chores done so that I
might have more time to read. When I was twelve
years old I had learned all that the teacher in a little
school at the cross roads could teach me, and then
I went to the high school in the little town of Spencer,
six miles away, traveling the distance twice
every day. When there was a horse available I rode,
if not, I walked. But whether riding or walking, I
always had a book in my hand, and read as I went
along. It often happened that, being deep in the
fortunes of my story book friends, I did not notice
when old Major ambled off the road in quest of a
nibble of clover, and would sometimes come to with
a start to find myself lying in the ditch. The neighbors
thought my actions scandalous and pitied my
father and mother because they had such a good-for-nothing
daughter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>All this time my father was getting poorer and
poorer. He changed from farming to cotton raising
and then made a failure of that, and finally, in
despair, he turned to raising horses, not beautiful
race horses like you read about in stories, but wiry
little cow ponies that the cattlemen use. For some
unaccountable reason he had good luck in this line
for three years in succession, and a year or so after
I had finished this little one-horse high school there
was enough money for me to climb over my Ozark
fence and go and play in the land of my dreams.
One wonderful year, that surpassed in reality anything
I had ever pictured in imagination, and then
the sky fell, and here I am, inside the fence once
more.</p>
<p>Not that I am sorry I came back, no sirree!
Father was so pleased and touched to think I gave
up my college course and came home that he chirked
up right away and started in from the beginning
once more to pay the mortgage off the land and the
stock, and mother is feeling well enough to be up
almost all day now; but to-day I just couldn&rsquo;t help
shedding a few perfectly good tears over what I
might be doing instead of what I am.</p>
<p>A flock of wild geese, headed south, flew above
my head in a dark triangle, and honked derisively
at me as they passed. &ldquo;Not even a goose would stop
off in this dismal country!&rdquo; I exclaimed aloud.
Then, simply wild for sympathy from someone, I
slid off Sandhelo&rsquo;s back and stood there, ankle deep
in the yellow mud, and put my arms around his
neck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sandhelo,&rdquo; I croaked dismally, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re all
I have left of my wonderful year up north. You
love me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sandhelo looked unfeelingly over my shoulder
at the rain splashing down into the road and
yawned elaborately right in my face. There are
times when Sandhelo shows no more feeling than
Eeny-Meeny. Seeing there was no sympathy to be
had from him, I climbed on his back again and rode
grimly home, trying to resign myself to a life of
school teaching at the cross roads, ending in an early
death from boredom.</p>
<p>Father was nowhere about when I rode into the
stableyard, and the door into the stable was shut.
I slid it back, with Sandhelo nosing at my arm all
the while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re affectionate enough now that you
want your dinner,&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help saying a little
spitefully. Then my heart melted toward him, and,
with my arm around his neck, we walked in together.
Inside of Sandhelo&rsquo;s stall I ran into something and
jumped as if I had been shot. In the dusk I could
make out the figure of a man sitting on the floor
and leaning against the wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Father?&rdquo; I asked, while Sandhelo
blinked in astonishment at this invasion of his premises.
There was no answer from the man on the
floor. Why I wasn&rsquo;t more excited I don&rsquo;t know,
but I calmly took the lantern down from the hook
and lit it and held it in front of me. The light
showed the man in Sandhelo&rsquo;s stall to be sound
asleep, with his hand leaned back against the wooden
partition. He had a black beard and his face was
all streaked with mud and dirt, and there was mud
even in his matted hair. He had no hat on. His
clothes were all covered with mud and one sleeve
of his coat was torn partly out.</p>
<p>Sandhelo put down his nose and sniffed inquiringly
at the stranger&rsquo;s feet. Without ceremony I
thrust the lantern right into the man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you and what are you doing here?&rdquo; I
said, loudly and firmly. The man stirred and opened
his eyes, and then sat up suddenly, blinking at the
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; I repeated sternly. The man
stared at me stupidly for an instant; then he passed
his hand over his forehead and stumbled to his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; he repeated wildly; then his face
screwed up into a frightful grimace and with a groan
he crumpled up on the floor. Leaving Sandhelo still
standing there gazing at him in mild astonishment,
I ran out calling for father.</p>
<p>Father came presently and took a long look at
the man in the stall, and then, without asking any
questions, he got a wet cloth and laid it on his head.
That washed some of the mud off and showed a big
bruise on his forehead over his left eye. Father
called the man that helps with the horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me carry this man into the house,&rdquo; he said
shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Father,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you surely aren&rsquo;t going to
carry that man into the house? All dirty like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father gave me one look and I said no more. Together
father and Jim Wiggin lifted the stranger
from the floor and started toward the house with
him, while I capered around in my excitement and
finally ran on ahead to tell mother. They carried
him into the kitchen and laid him down on the old
lounge and tried to bring him around with smelling
salts and things. But he just kept on talking and
muttering to himself, and never opened his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s still doing, while I&rsquo;m off in
my room writing this. It was five o&rsquo;clock when we
brought him in, and now it&rsquo;s after ten and he hasn&rsquo;t
come to his senses yet. There isn&rsquo;t a thing in his
pockets to show who he is or where he came from.</p>
<p>I feel so strange since I found that man there.
I&rsquo;m not a bit low in my mind any more, like I was
this afternoon. I have a curious feeling as if I had
passed a turn in the road and come upon something
new and wonderful.</p>
<p>Forget the lengthy moan I indulged in at the beginning
of this letter, will you, and think of me as
gay and chipper as ever.</p>

<h3>KATHERINE TO THE WINNEBAGOS</h3>
<p><span class="date">Oct. 15, 19&mdash;.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Darling Winnies:</span></p>
<p>And to think, after all that fuss I made about not
getting a letter from you that day, I didn&rsquo;t have
time to open it for three whole days after it finally
arrived! You remember where I left off the last
time, with the strange man I had found in Sandhelo&rsquo;s
stable out of his head on the kitchen lounge?
Well, he kept on like that, lying with his eyes shut
and occasionally saying a word or two that didn&rsquo;t
make sense, all that night and all the next day.
Then on Sunday he developed a high fever and began
to rave. He shouted at the top of his voice
until he was hoarse; always about somebody pursuing
him and whom he was trying to run away
from. Then he began to jump up and try to run
outdoors, until we had to bar the door. It took all
father and Jim Wiggin and I could do to keep him
on the lounge. We had a pretty exciting time of
it, I can tell you. Of course, all the uproar upset
mother and she had another spell with her heart and
took to her bed, and by Tuesday night things got
so strenuous that I had to dismiss school for the rest
of the week and keep all my ten fingers in the domestic
pie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who rejoiced more over the unexpected
lapse from lessons, the scholars or myself.
I never saw a group of children who were so constitutionally
opposed to learning as the twenty-two
stony-faced specimens of &ldquo;hoomanity&rdquo; that I had
to deal with in that little shanty of a school. They&rsquo;d
rather be ignorant than educated any day. I just
can&rsquo;t make them do the homework I give them.
Every day it&rsquo;s the same story. They haven&rsquo;t done
their examples and they haven&rsquo;t learned their spelling;
they haven&rsquo;t studied their geography. The only
way I can get them to study their lessons is to keep
them in after school and stand over them while they
do it. Their only motto seems to be, &ldquo;Pa and ma
didn&rsquo;t have no education and they got along, so why
should we bother?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>The families from which these children come are
what is known in this section as &ldquo;Hard-uppers,&rdquo;
people who are and have always been &ldquo;hard up.&rdquo;
Nearly everybody around here is a Hard-upper. If
they weren&rsquo;t they wouldn&rsquo;t be here. The land is
so poor that nobody will pay any price for it, so it
has drifted into the hands of shiftless people who
couldn&rsquo;t get along anywhere, and they work it in a
backward, inefficient sort of way and make such a
bare living that you couldn&rsquo;t call it a living at all.
They live in little houses that aren&rsquo;t much more than
cabins&mdash;some of them have only one or two rooms
in them&mdash;and haven&rsquo;t one of the comforts that you
girls think you absolutely couldn&rsquo;t live without.
They have no books, no pictures, no magazines. It&rsquo;s
no wonder the children are stony-faced when I try
to shower blessings upon them in the form of spelling
and grammar; they know they won&rsquo;t have a mite
of use for them if they do learn them, so why take
the trouble?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a dreadful set of people!&rdquo; I can hear you
say disdainfully. &ldquo;How can you stand it among
such poor trash?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>O my Belov&eacute;ds, I have a sad admission to make.
I am a Hard-upper myself! My father, while he is
the dearest daddy in the world, never had
a scrap of business ability; that&rsquo;s how he came
to live in this made-out-of-the-scraps-after-every-thing-else-was-made
corner of Arkansas. He never
had any education either, though it wasn&rsquo;t because
he didn&rsquo;t want it. He doesn&rsquo;t care a rap for reading;
all he cares for is horses. We live in a shack,
too, though it has four rooms and is much better
than most around here. We never had any books
or magazines, either, except the ones for which I
sacrificed everything else I wanted to buy. But I
wanted to learn,&mdash;oh, how I wanted to learn!&mdash;and
that&rsquo;s where I differed altogether from the rest of
the Hard-uppers. They&rsquo;re still wagging their heads
about the way I used to walk along the road reading.
The very first week I taught school this year I was
taking Absalom Butts (mentioned in my former
epistle) to task for speaking saucily to me, and
thinking to impress him with the dignity of my position
I said, &ldquo;Do you know whom you&rsquo;re talking
to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he answered back impudently, &ldquo;Yer Bill
Adamses good-for-nothing daughter, that&rsquo;s who you
are!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>You see what I&rsquo;m up against? Those children
hear their parents make such remarks about me
and they haven&rsquo;t the slightest respect for me. Did
you know that I only got this job of teaching because
nobody else would take it? Absalom Butts&rsquo;
father, who is about the only man around here who
isn&rsquo;t a Hard-upper, and is the most influential man
in the community because he can talk the loudest,
held out against me to the very end, declaring I
hadn&rsquo;t enough sense to come in out of the rain. As
he is president of the school board in this township&mdash;the
whole thing is a farce, but the members are
tremendously impressed with their own dignity&mdash;it
pretty nearly ended up in your little Katherine not
getting any school to teach this winter, but when one
applicant after another came and saw and turned
up her nose, it became a question of me or no schoolmarm,
so they gave me the place, but with much
misgiving. I had become very much discouraged
over the whole business, for I really needed the
money, and began to consider myself a regular idiot,
but father said I needn&rsquo;t worry very much about
being considered a good-for-nothing by Elijah
Butts; his whole grudge against me rose from the
fact that he had wanted to marry my mother when
she was young and had never forgiven father for
beating him to it. That cheered me up considerably,
and I determined to swallow no slights from the
family of Butts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Since then it&rsquo;s been nip and tuck between us.
Young Absalom is a big, overgrown gawk of fourteen
with no brain for anything but mischief. His
chief aim in life just now is to think up something
to annoy me. I ignore him as much as possible so
as not to give him the satisfaction of knowing he
can annoy me, but about every three days we have
a regular pitched battle, and it keeps me worn out.
His sister Clarissa hasn&rsquo;t enough brain for mischief,
but her constant flow of tears is nearly as bad as his
impudence.</p>
<p>Taken all in all, you can guess that I didn&rsquo;t shed
any tears about having to close the school that Tuesday
to help take care of the sick man. Anything,
even sitting on a delirious stranger, was a relief
from the constant warfare of teaching school. It
was in the midst of this mess that your letter came,
and lay three whole days before I had time to open
it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>On Saturday the sick man stopped raving and
struggling and lay perfectly motionless. Jim Wiggin
looked at his white, sunken face, and remarked
oracularly, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a goner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even father shook his head and asked me to ride
Sandhelo over to Spencer and fetch the doctor again.
I went, feeling queer and shaky. Nobody had ever
died in our house and the thought gave me a chill.
I wished he had never come, because the business had
upset mother so. Besides that, the man himself bothered
me. Who was he, wandering around like that
among strangers and dying in the house of a man
he had never seen? How could we notify his family&mdash;if
he had a family? I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking
how dreadful it would be if my father were to be
taken sick away from home like that, and we never
knowing what had become of him. I was quite low
in my mind again by the time I had come back with
the doctor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>But while I had been away a change came over
the sick man. He still lay like dead with his eyes
closed, but he seemed to be breathing differently.
The doctor said he was asleep; the fever had left
him. He wasn&rsquo;t going to die under a strange roof
after all. When he wakened he was conscious, but
the doctor wouldn&rsquo;t let us ask him any questions.
He slept nearly all day Sunday and on Monday I
went back to school. When I came home Monday
night I had the surprise of my young life. When I
looked over at the lounge to see how the sick man
was to-day I saw, not a man, but a boy lying there.
A white-faced boy with a sensitive, beautiful mouth,
wan cheeks and great black eyes that seemed to be
the biggest part of his face. My books clattered to
the floor in my astonishment. Father came in just
then and laughed at my amazed face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a different-looking bird, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;The doctor was in again to-day and shaved him.
It does make quite a difference, now, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
he finished.</p>
<p>Difference! I should say it did! I had thought
all the while that he was a man, because he wore a
beard; it had never occurred to me that the hair had
grown out on his face from neglect, and not because
he wanted it there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I must have looked frightful,&rdquo; said
the boy in a weak voice, but with a smile of amusement
in his eyes. Those were the first words I had
heard him speak to anyone, and that was the first
time he had had his eyes wide open and looked directly
at me. For the life of me I couldn&rsquo;t stop staring
at him. I couldn&rsquo;t get over how beautiful he
was. He had been so repulsive before, with his hair
all matted and his face discolored by bruises; now
his hair was clipped short and was very soft and
black and shiny. One small transparent hand lay
on top of the blanket. He didn&rsquo;t look a day over
eighteen.</p>
<p>He lay there half smiling at me and suddenly
for no reason at all I felt large and awkward and
sloppy. Involuntarily my hand flew to the back of
my belt to see if I was coming to pieces, and I stole
a stealthy glance at my feet to see if the shoes I
had on were mates. I was glad when he closed his
eyes and I could slip out of the room unnoticed. I
suppose mother wondered why I was so long getting
supper ready that night. But the truth of the
matter is I spent fifteen minutes hunting through
my bureau drawers for that list of rules of neatness
that Gladys made out for me last summer, and which
I had never thought of once since coming home. I
unearthed them at last and applied them carefully
to my toilet before reappearing in the kitchen. My
hair was very trying; it <i>would</i> hang down in my
eyes until at last in desperation I tucked it under a
cap. As a rule I loathe caps. Just as soon as this
letter reaches you, Gladys, will you send me that
recipe for hand lotion you told me you used? My
hands are a fright, all red and rough. Don&rsquo;t wait
until the letters from the other girls are ready, but
send the recipe right on by return mail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>After supper that night we talked to the man on
the couch. At first he seemed very unwilling to tell
anything about himself. We finally got from him
that his name was Justice Sherman; that he was
from Texas, where he had been working on a sheep
ranch; that he had left there and gone up into
Oklahoma and had worked at various places; that
he had gradually worked his way into Arkansas;
that he had fallen in with bad men who had attacked
and robbed him and left him lying senseless in the
road with his head cut open; that he had wandered
around several days in the rain half out of his head,
trying to get someone to take him in, but he looked
so frightful that everyone turned him out and set
the dogs on him, until finally he had stumbled over
a stone and broken his ankle and dragged himself
into our stable and crept into Sandhelo&rsquo;s stall.
That&rsquo;s what had made him crumple up on the floor
the day I found him when he tried to get up. He
had fainted from the pain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>We asked him if he wouldn&rsquo;t like us to write to
his family or his friends and he answered wearily
that he had no family and no friends in particular
that he would care to notify. Then he closed his
eyes and one corner of his mouth drew up as if with
pain. Poor fellow, I suppose that ankle did hurt
horribly.</p>
<p>Now, you best and dearest of Winnebagos, let the
dear Round Robin letter come chirping along just
as soon as you can, and I&rsquo;ll promise not to let it lie
three days this time before I read it.</p>

<h3>GLADYS TO KATHERINE</h3>
<p><span class="date">Brownell College, Oct. 18, 19&mdash;.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Darling Katherine:</span></p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re settled at last, though it did seem at
first as though we were going to spend all our college
life wandering around with our belongings in
our arms. We came a day late and found the room
we had arranged for occupied by someone else.
Through a mistake it had been assigned to us after
it had been once assigned to these other two, so we
had to relinquish our claim. The freshman dormitory
was full to the eaves and we realized that there
wasn&rsquo;t going to be any place for us. We made our
roomless plight known and to make up for it we
were told there was a vacant double in the sophomore
dormitory that we might take provided no
sophomores wanted it. We hadn&rsquo;t expected such
an honor and sped like the wind after our belongings.
The sophomore dormitory is right across from
the freshman one; they are called Paradise and Purgatory,
respectively. It sounded awfully funny to
us at first to hear the girls asking each other where
they were and to hear them answer, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in Paradise,&rdquo;
or, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in Purgatory.&rdquo; We were overcome
with joy when we discovered that Migwan roomed
in Paradise. Our room was way up on the third
floor and hers was down on second, but to be under
the same roof with her was such a comfort that all
our troubles seemed over for good. We just had
our things pretty well straightened out and Hinpoha
was nailing her shoebag to the closet door when the
sky fell and we were informed that a couple of
sophomores wanted our room, and, as there was now
a vacancy in the freshman dormitory, would we
kindly move? So we were thrown out of Paradise
and landed in Purgatory after all, and, for the second
time that day, we trailed across the campus with
our arms full of personal property, strewing table
covers and laundry bags in our wake. We didn&rsquo;t
have time to straighten out before exams began and
for two days we lived like shipwrecked sailors with
the goods that had been saved from the wreck piled
on the floor and when we wanted anything we had
to rummage for half an hour before we found it.
Even after we had survived exams we were half
afraid to begin settling for fear we would be ordered
to move once more. We couldn&rsquo;t quite believe that
we were anchored at last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>The first week went around very fast; we were
so busy getting our classes straightened out and
learning our way through the different buildings that
we didn&rsquo;t have time to feel homesick. But by Saturday
the first strangeness had worn off; we had
stopped wandering into senior class rooms and professors&rsquo;
committee meetings, but still we hadn&rsquo;t had
time to get very well acquainted. Saturday afternoon
was perfect weather and most everybody in
the house had gone off for a walk, but we had stayed
at home to finish putting our room to rights. When
everything was finally in place we sat down on the
bed and looked at each other. Hinpoha&rsquo;s eyes suddenly
filled with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want the other Winnebagos!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t live without them. I want Sahwah and Nakwisi
and Medmangi, and I want Katherine!
Oh-h-h-h, I want Katherine! How will we ever get
along without her here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>And we both sat there and wanted you so hard
that it seemed as if the heavens must open up and
drop you down on the bed beside us. Katherine, do
you know that you have ruined our whole lives?
Why, O why did you come to us only to go away
again? You got us so in the habit of looking to
you to tell us what to do next that now we aren&rsquo;t
able to start a thing for ourselves. We knew that
if you had been there with us that first week you
would have had the whole house in an uproar and
something wonderful would have been happening
every minute. But for the life of us we couldn&rsquo;t
think of a single thing to do for ourselves.</p>
<p>We were still sitting there steeped in gloom when
Migwan came in to see how we were getting on.
She had some delicious milk chocolate with her and
that cheered Hinpoha up quite a bit. It&rsquo;s going to
be a heavenly comfort to have Migwan just ahead
of us in college. She knows all the ropes and the
teachers and the gossip about the upper classmen
and tells us things that keep us from making the
ridiculous mistakes so many of the freshmen make
all the time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But just think how <i>I</i> felt here, all alone, last
year,&rdquo; said Migwan. &ldquo;Perhaps I didn&rsquo;t miss you
girls, though! You were still altogether and had
Nyoda, but here there wasn&rsquo;t a soul who had ever
heard of the Winnebagos. Now it seems like old
times again. Think of it, three whole Winnebagos
living together almost under the same roof! Didn&rsquo;t
we say that night when we had our last Council Fire
with Nyoda that although we couldn&rsquo;t be together
any more, we were still Winnebagos and were loyal
friends and true, and that wherever two Winnebagos
should meet, whether it was in the street, or
on mid-ocean, or in a far country, right then and
there would take place a Winnebago meeting?
Why, we&rsquo;re having a Winnebago meeting this very
minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep on having meetings, as often as we
can, just us three,&rdquo; said Hinpoha, &ldquo;and talk over
old times and have &lsquo;Counts.&rsquo; We can call ourselves
The Last of the Winnebagos, like the Last of the
Mohicans, and our password will be &lsquo;Remember!&rsquo;
That means, &lsquo;Remember the old days!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Migwan smiled a little mysteriously, but she
agreed that it was a fine idea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>We three sat down on the floor in a Wohelo
triangle and repeated our Desire and promised to
seek beauty in everything that came along, and to
give service to all the other girls in college whenever
we had the chance, and to pursue knowledge for all
we were worth now that there was so much of it on
every side of us, and to be trustworthy and obey all
the rules to the smallest detail and never cheat at
exams, and to glorify work until everybody noticed
how well we did everything, and hold on to health
by not sitting up late studying and eating horrible
messes, and to be happy all the time and try to like
every girl in college.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s clasp hands on it,&rdquo; said Hinpoha, and we
did, and then stood up and sang &ldquo;Wohelo for Aye&rdquo;
until the window rattled. (It&rsquo;s awfully loose and
rattles at the slightest pretext.)</p>
<p>We had just gotten to the last &ldquo;Wohelo for Love&rdquo;
when all of a sudden a face appeared at the window.
We were all so surprised we stopped short and the
last syllable of &ldquo;Wohelo&rdquo; was chopped off as if
somebody had taken a knife. Our room is on the
third floor, and for anyone to look in at the window
they would have to be suspended in the air. So
when that head appeared without any warning we
all stood petrified and stared open-mouthed. It was
a girl&rsquo;s head with very black hair and very red lips.
At first the face just looked at us; then when it saw
our amazement it grinned from ear to ear in the
widest grin I ever saw.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did I scare you?&rdquo; said the face in a voice so
rich and deep that we jumped again. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not
Hamlet, thy father&rsquo;s ghost, I&rsquo;m Agony, thy next
door neighbor. I heard you singing &lsquo;Wohelo for
Aye&rsquo; and I just looked in to see if I could believe my
ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all ran to the window and then we saw how
easily the thing had been done. Our window is right
up against the corner of our room and the window
in the other room is right next to it, so that all the
apparition had to do was lean out of her window
and look into ours, which was open from the bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on over!&rdquo; we urged hospitably.</p>
<p>The apparition withdrew from the window and
appeared a moment later in the doorway, leading a
second apparition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I brought my better half along,&rdquo; said the deep,
rich voice again, as the two girls came into the
room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>They looked so much alike that we knew at a
glance they were sisters. The one who had looked
in at the window did the introducing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re the Wing twins,&rdquo; she said, as if she took
it for granted that we had heard about them already.
&ldquo;<i>She&rsquo;s</i> Oh-Pshaw and I&rsquo;m Agony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-Pshaw and Agony?&rdquo; we repeated wonderingly,
whereupon the twins burst out laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, those are not our real names,&rdquo; said Agony,
&ldquo;but we&rsquo;ve been called that so long that it seems as
if they were. Her name&rsquo;s Alta and mine&rsquo;s Agnes.
I&rsquo;ve been nicknamed Agony ever since I can remember,
and Alta got the habit of saying &lsquo;Oh-Pshaw!&rsquo;
at everything until the girls at the boarding
school where we went always called her that
and the name stuck. You pronounce it this way,
&lsquo;<i>Oh</i>-Pshaw,&rsquo; with the accent on the &lsquo;Oh.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were friends all in a minute. How in the
world could you be stiff and formal with two girls
whose names were Agony and <i>Oh</i>-Pshaw?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We heard you singing &lsquo;Wohelo for Aye,&rsquo;&rdquo;
Agony explained, &ldquo;and it made us so homesick we almost
went up in smoke. We belonged to the corkingest
group back home. It nearly killed us off to
go away and leave them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>Here <i>Oh</i>-Pshaw broke in and took up the tale.
&ldquo;When we heard that song coming from next door
Agony squealed, &lsquo;Camp Fire Girls!&rsquo; and began to
dance a jig. She wouldn&rsquo;t wait until I got my hair
done so we could come over and call; she just
stretched her neck until it reached into your window.
Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re next door to us I
could just pass away!&rdquo; And <i>Oh</i>-Pshaw caught
Agony around the neck and they both lost their balance
on the foot of the bed and rolled over on the
pillows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you have such dandy nicknames,&rdquo;
said Migwan. &ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t have them we could
call you First Apparition and Second Apparition,
like Macbeth, you know. But the ones you have are
far superior to anything we could think up now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then we told them about the Winnebagos and
about you and Sahwah and the rest of them, and
how we had formed THE LAST OF THE WINNEBAGOS
and meant to have meetings right along.
Of course, we asked them to come and &ldquo;Remember&rdquo;
their lost group with us, and they were perfectly
wild about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have our first meeting right now,&rdquo; proposed
Agony, &ldquo;and go on a long hike. It&rsquo;s a scrumptious
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We flew to get our hats and Hinpoha was in such
a hurry that she knocked over the Japanese screen
that stands gracefully across one corner of our room
and that brought to light the pile of things that we
just naturally couldn&rsquo;t fit into the room anywhere
and had chucked behind the screen until we decided
how to get rid of them. There was Hinpoha&rsquo;s desk
lamp, the one with the light green shade with
bunches of purple grapes on it&mdash;a perfect beauty,
only there was no room for it after we&rsquo;d decided to
use mine with the two lamps in it; and an extra rug
and a book rack and a Rookwood bowl and quantities
of pictures. You see, we&rsquo;d both brought along
enough stuff to furnish a room twice the size of
ours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever will we do with those things?&rdquo; sighed
Hinpoha in despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you give them to somebody?&rdquo; suggested
Migwan. &ldquo;That lamp and that vase are perfect
beauties. I&rsquo;d covet them myself if I didn&rsquo;t have
more now than I know what to do with.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The very thing!&rdquo; said Hinpoha. &ldquo;Here we
promised not a half hour ago to &lsquo;Give Service&rsquo; all
the time, and yet we didn&rsquo;t think of sharing
our possessions. To whom shall we give
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Sally Prindle,&rdquo; said Agony and Oh-Pshaw
in one breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Sally Prindle?&rdquo; asked Hinpoha and I,
also in chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She lives down at the other end of the hall in
Purgatory,&rdquo; said Agony, &ldquo;in that tiny little box of
a room at the head of the stairs. She&rsquo;s working her
way through college and waits on table for her
board and does some of the upstairs work for her
room, and she&rsquo;s awfully poor. She hasn&rsquo;t a thing
in her room but the bare furniture&mdash;not a rug or a
picture. She&rsquo;d probably be crazy to get them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give them to her right away,&rdquo; said Hinpoha,
beginning to gather things up in her arms.
Hinpoha is just like a whirlwind when she gets enthusiastic
about anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how shall we give them to her?&rdquo; I asked.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know her, and she might feel offended if
she thought we had noticed how bare her room was
and pitied her. How shall we manage it, Migwan?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t act as if you pitied her at all,&rdquo; replied
Migwan. &ldquo;Simply knock at her door and tell her
you&rsquo;ve got your room all furnished and there are
some things left over and you&rsquo;re going up and down
the corridor trying to find out if anybody has room
to take care of them for you until the end of the
year. Of course she has room to take them, so it
will be very simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Migwan, what would we do without you?&rdquo;
cried Hinpoha, and nearly dropped the Rookwood
bowl trying to hug her with her arms full. &ldquo;You
always know the right thing to do and say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agony and Oh-Pshaw stopped into their room on
the way up and came out with a leather pillow and
an ivory clock to add to the collection. Their room
wasn&rsquo;t too full, but they wanted to do something
for Sally, too. We had to knock on Sally&rsquo;s door
twice before she opened it and we were beginning to
be afraid she wasn&rsquo;t at home. When she did come
to the door she didn&rsquo;t ask us in; but just stood looking
at us and our armful of things as if to ask what
we wanted. She was a tall, stoop-shouldered girl
with spectacles and a wrinkle running up and down
on her forehead between her eyes. The room was
just as bare as Agony had described; it looked like
a cell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re making a tour of Purgatory trying to dispose
of our surplus furniture,&rdquo; I said, trying to be
offhand, &ldquo;Have you any room to spare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Sally with a snap.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the third bunch to-day that&rsquo;s tried to decorate
my room for me. When I want any donations
I&rsquo;ll ask for them.&rdquo; And she shut the door right in
our faces.</p>
<p>We backed away in such a hurry that Agony
dropped the clock and it went rolling and bumping
down the stairway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all things!&rdquo; said Agony. &ldquo;I wish poor people
wouldn&rsquo;t be so disagreeable about it. I&rsquo;m sure
I&rsquo;d be tickled to death to use anybody&rsquo;s surplus to
make up what I lacked. Well, we&rsquo;ve tried to &lsquo;Give
Service&rsquo; anyway, and if it didn&rsquo;t work it wasn&rsquo;t our
fault. I think there ought to be a law about &lsquo;Taking
Service&rsquo; as well as Giving. Now let&rsquo;s hurry up
and go for our hike before the sun goes down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>We went out and had the most glorious tramp
over the hills and found a tiny little village that
looks the same as it must have a hundred years ago,
and then we came back and had hot chocolate in a
darling little shop that was just jammed with students.
Agony and Oh-Pshaw know just quantities
of girls, and introduced us to dozens, and we went
back to Purgatory too happy to think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; said Migwan, as she came into
the room with us for a minute to get a book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you tell us?&rdquo; asked Hinpoha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant about us three trying to have meetings
just by ourselves and trying to do exactly what we
did when we were Winnebagos. It won&rsquo;t work.
You&rsquo;ll keep on making new friends all the time that
you&rsquo;ll love just as much as the old ones. Don&rsquo;t forget
the old Winnebagos, but don&rsquo;t mourn because the
old days have come to an end. There&rsquo;s more fun
coming to you than you&rsquo;ve ever had before in your
lives, so be on the lookout for it every minute.
&lsquo;Remember!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, Katherine, we just love college, and the only
fly in the ointment is that you aren&rsquo;t here!</p>

<h3>KATHERINE TO THE WINNEBAGOS</h3>
<p><span class="date">Nov. 1, 19&mdash;.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Dearest Winnies:</span></p>
<p>Well, Justice Sherman may be a sheep herder and
a son of the pasture, but I hae me doots. I know
a hawk from a handsaw if I was born and bred in
the backwoods. I know it isn&rsquo;t polite to doubt people&rsquo;s
word, and he seemed to be telling an absolutely
straight story when he told how he beat his way
across from Texas, but for all that there&rsquo;s some
mystery about him. His manners betrayed him the
first time he ever sat down to the table with us.
Even though he limped badly and was still awfully
wobbly, he stood behind my mother&rsquo;s chair and
shoved it in for her and then hobbled over and did
the same for me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>You can see it, can&rsquo;t you? The table set in the
kitchen&mdash;for our humble cot does not boast of a
dining room&mdash;father and Jim Wiggin collarless and
in their shirtsleeves, and the stranded sheep herder
waiting upon mother and me as if we were queens.
For no reason at all I suddenly became abashed. I
felt my face flaming to the roots of my hair, and
absentmindedly began to eat my soup with a fork,
whereat Jim Wiggin set up a great thundering haw!
haw! Jim had been a sheep herder before he came
to take care of father&rsquo;s horses, and it struck me
forcibly just then that there was a wide difference
between him and the stranger within our gates.</p>
<p>I said something to father about it that night
when we were out in the stable together giving Sandhelo
his nightly dole. Father rubbed his nose with
the back of his hand, a sign that a thing is of no
concern to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you get to worryin&rsquo; about the stranger&rsquo;s
affairs,&rdquo; he advised mildly. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s got something
he doesn&rsquo;t want to tell, you ain&rsquo;t got no business
tryin&rsquo; to find it out. Tend to your own affairs, I
say, and leave others&rsquo; alone. There ain&rsquo;t nobody
goin&rsquo; to be pestered with embarrassing questions
while they&rsquo;re under my roof.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>So I promised not to ask any questions. Just
about the time the stranger&rsquo;s foot was well enough
to walk on, Jim Wiggin stepped on a rusty nail and
laid himself up. Justice Sherman was a godsend
just then because men were so hard to get, and
father hired him to help with the horses until Jim
was about again. Father begged me again at this
time not to ask him anything about his past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as soon as he thinks we&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; curious
he&rsquo;ll up and leave,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and that would put us
in a bad way. Help is so scarce now I don&rsquo;t know
where I <i>would</i> get an extra man. Seems almost as
though the hand of Providence had sent him to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was perfectly true. Since so many men had
gone into the army it was next thing to impossible
to get any help on the farms except good-for-nothing
negroes that weren&rsquo;t worth their salt. It
seemed, indeed, an act of Providence to cast an
able man at our door just at this juncture. So I
promised again not to bother the man with questions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Indeed, it bade fair to be an easy matter not to
ask him any questions. Beyond a few polite words
at meals he never said anything at all, and as he
had moved his sleeping quarters to a small cabin
away from the house I saw very little of him, and
I suppose we never would have gotten any better
acquainted if your letter hadn&rsquo;t come that Friday.
Friday is the worst day of the week for me, because
after five days of constant set-to-ing with Absalom
Butts my philosophy is at its lowest ebb. This
week was the worst because I had a visitation from
the school board to see how I was getting on, and,
of course, none of the pupils knew a thing and most
of them acted as if the very devil of mischief had
gotten into them. Elijah Butts gave me a solemn
warning that I would have to keep better order if
I wanted to stay in the school, and Absalom, who
had been hanging around listening, made an impudent
grimace at me and laughed in a taunting
manner. If I hadn&rsquo;t needed the money so badly I
would have thrown up the job right there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>Then, on top of that, came your letter describing
the supergorgeousness of your college rooms,
and when I thought of the room I had planned to
have at college this winter, adjoining yours, my
heart turned to water within me and melancholy
marked me for its own. I wept large and pearly
tears which Niagara-ed over the end of my nose and
sizzled on the hot stove, as I stood in the kitchen
stirring a pudding for supper. Get the effect, do
you? Me standing there with the spoon in one
hand and your letter in the other, doing the Niobe
act, quite oblivious to the fact that I was not the
only person in the county. I was just in the act of
swallowing a small rapid which had gotten side-tracked
from the main channel and gone whirlpooling
down my Sunday throat, when a voice behind
me said, &ldquo;Did you get bad news in your letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I jumped so I dropped the letter right into the
pudding. I made a savage dab at my eyes with the
corner of my apron and wheeled around furiously.
There stood the Justice Sherman person looking
at me with his solemn black eyes. I was ready to
die with shame at being caught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I exploded, mopping my face vehemently
with my apron, and thereby capping the
climax. For while I had been reading your letter
and absently stirring the pudding it had slopped
over and run down the front of my apron, and, of
course, I had to use just that part to wipe my face
with. The pudding was huckleberry, and what it
did to my features is beyond description. I caught
one glimpse of myself in the mirror over the sink
and then I sank down into a chair and just yelled.
Justice Sherman doubled up against the door frame
in a regular spasm of mirth, although he tried not
to make much noise about it. Finally he bolted out
of the door and came back with a basin of water
from the pump, which he set down beside me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;remove the marks of bloody
carnage, before you scare the wolf from the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I scrubbed, wishing all the while that he would
go away, and still furious for having made such a
spectacle of myself. But he stayed around, and
when I resembled a human being once more (if I
ever could be said to resemble one), he came over
and handed me the letter, which he had fished out
of the pudding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the fatal missive,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or would
you rather leave it in the pudding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw it into the fire,&rdquo; I commanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the right way,&rdquo; he said approvingly. &ldquo;I
always burn bad news myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t bad news,&rdquo; I insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why the tears?&rdquo; he inquired curiously.
&ldquo;Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>He was smiling, but somehow I had a feeling that
he was trying to cheer me up and not making fun
of me. I was so low in my mind that afternoon that
anyone who acted in the least degree sympathetic
was destined to fall a victim. Before I knew it I
had told him of my shipwrecked hopes and how your
letter had opened the flood gates of disappointment
and nearly put out the kitchen fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;College&mdash;you!&rdquo; I heard him exclaim under his
breath. He stared at me solemnly for a moment and
then he exclaimed, &ldquo;O tempora, O mores! What&rsquo;s
to hinder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to hinder?&rdquo; I repeated blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;having the room anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;you have a room of your
own, haven&rsquo;t you? Why don&rsquo;t you fix it up just the
way you had planned to have your room in college?
Then you can go there and study and make believe
you&rsquo;re in college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stared at him open-mouthed. &ldquo;Make-believe
has never been my long suit,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you fix it up.
If you have any more tears prepare to shed them
now into the paint pot and dissolve the paint.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Before I knew what had happened we had laid
forcible hands on the bare little cell I had indifferently
been inhabiting all these years and transformed
it into the study of my dreams. We cut a window
in the side that faces in the direction of the mountains
and made a corking window seat out of a
packing case, on which I piled cushions stuffed with
thistle down. We papered the whole place with
light yellow paper, tacked up my last year&rsquo;s school
pennants and put up a book shelf. This last proved
to be a delusion and a snare, because one end of it
came down in the middle of the night not long afterward
and all the books came tobogganing on top of
me in bed. As a finishing touch, I brought out the
snowshoes and painted paddle that were a relic of
my Golden Age, and which I had never had the heart
to unpack since I came home. When finished the
effect was quite epic, though I suppose it would
make Hinpoha&rsquo;s artistic eye water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>Of course, it will never make up for not going
to college, but it helped some, and in working at it
I got very well acquainted with Justice Sherman
all of a sudden. We had long talks about everything
under the sun, and he continually bubbled over
with funny sayings. He confided to me that he had
never been so surprised in all his life as when I told
him I wanted to go to college. You see, he had
thought we were like the other poor whites in the
neighborhood, and I was like the other girls he had
seen. He didn&rsquo;t take any interest in me until I
bowled him over with the statement that I had already
passed my college entrance exams.</p>
<p>All this time I never hinted that I suspected he
was not the simple sheep herder he pretended to be.
I had given father my word and, of course, had to
keep it. But one afternoon the Fates had their fingers
crossed, and Pandora like, I got my foot in it.
I had driven Justice over to Spencer in the rattledy
old cart with Sandhelo. On the way we talked of
many things, and I came home surer than ever that
he was no sheep herder. Once when the conversation
lagged and in the silence Sandhelo&rsquo;s heels
seemed to be beating out a tune as they clicked along,
I remarked ruminatingly, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a line in Virgil
that is supposed to imitate the sound of galloping
horses.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quadrupedante putrem sonitu quatit angula campam,</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>quoted Justice promptly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>So he was on quoting terms with Virgil! But I
remembered my promise and made no remarks.</p>
<p>A little later I was telling about the winter hike
we had taken on snowshoes last year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to see the sport they have on snowshoes
in Switzerland,&rdquo; he began with kindling eyes.
Then he broke off suddenly and changed the subject.</p>
<p>So Texas sheep herders learn their trade in Switzerland!
But again I yanked on the curb rein of my
curiosity. I apparently took no notice of his remark,
for <a href="#front">just then a negro stepped suddenly from
behind the bushes along the road and startled Sandhelo
so that he promptly became temperamental and
sat up on his haunches to get a better look at the
apparition</a>, and the mess he made of the harness
furnished us plenty of theme for conversation for
the next ten minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, what an ape,&rdquo; remarked Justice, gazing
after the departing form of the negro shambling
along the road, &ldquo;he looks like the things you see in
nightmares.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>Accustomed as I was to seeing low-down niggers,
this one struck me as being the worst specimen nature
had ever produced. He had the features of a
baboon, and the flapping rags of the grotesque garments
he wore made him look like a wild creature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have many such intellectual-looking gentlemen
around here?&rdquo; asked Justice, twisting his
neck around for a final look at the fellow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
hate to meet that professor at the dark of the
moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re really not as bad as they look,&rdquo; I replied.
&ldquo;They look like apes, but they&rsquo;re quite
harmless. They&rsquo;re shiftless to the last degree, but
not violent. They&rsquo;re too lazy to do any mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same, I&rsquo;d rather not get into an argument
with that particular brother, if it&rsquo;s all the same
to you,&rdquo; answered Justice. &ldquo;He looks like mischief
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> look like a prize entry in a beauty
contest,&rdquo; I admitted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>With all that talk about the negro Justice&rsquo;s remark
about Switzerland went unheeded, but I didn&rsquo;t
forget it just the same. I thought about it all the
rest of the afternoon and it was as plain as the nose
on your face that there was some mystery about
Justice Sherman. A sheep herder who spouted Virgil
at a touch, quoted continually from the classics,
had refined manners and had traveled abroad,
couldn&rsquo;t hide his light under a bushel very well. Another
thing; he wasn&rsquo;t a Texan as he had led us to
believe. He talked with the crisp, clear accent of the
North, and the fuss he made about the negro in the
road that afternoon betrayed the fact that he was
no southerner. Nobody around here pays any attention
to niggers, no matter how tattered they are.
We&rsquo;re used to them, but northerners always make a
fuss.</p>
<p>The question bubbled up and down in my mind,
keeping time to the bubbling of the soup on the
stove; why was this educated and refined young man
working for thirty dollars a month as a handy man
around horses on a third-rate stock farm in this
God-forsaken part of the country? Then a suspicion
flashed into my mind and at the dreadful
thought I stopped stirring with the upraised spoon
frozen in mid-air. Then I gathered my wits together
and started resolutely for the table. I had
promised father I would never ask Justice Sherman
anything about his past, but here was something that
swept aside all personal obligations and promises.
I found him with father in the stable working over
a sick colt. I marched straight up to him and began
without any preamble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Justice Sherman,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;are you
hiding yourself to avoid military service? Are you
a slacker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Justice Sherman straightened up and looked at
me with flashing eyes. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; he shouted
in a voice quite unlike his.</p>
<p>I never saw anyone in such a rage. His face was
as red as a beet and his hair actually stood on end.
&ldquo;I registered for the service,&rdquo; he went on hotly, &ldquo;and
wasn&rsquo;t called in the draft. I tried to enlist and they
wouldn&rsquo;t take me. I was under weight and had a
weak throat. If anyone thinks I&rsquo;m a slacker,
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Here he choked and had a violent coughing
spell.</p>
<p>I stared at him, dazed. I never thought he could
get so angry. He looked at me with hostile, indignant
eyes. Then he straightened up stiffly and
walked out of the stable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stay here any longer,&rdquo; he exploded, still
at the boiling point. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be insulted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I apologize,&rdquo; I said humbly. &ldquo;I spoke in haste.
Won&rsquo;t you please consider it unsaid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, he wouldn&rsquo;t consider it unsaid. He wouldn&rsquo;t
listen to father&rsquo;s pathetic plea not to leave him without
a helper. We suspected him of being a slacker
and that finished it. He would leave immediately.
Down the road he marched as fast as he could go
without ever turning his head.</p>
<p>A worm in the dust was much too exalted to describe
the way I felt. With the best of intentions I
had precipitated a calamity, taking away father&rsquo;s
best helper at a critical time, to say nothing of my
losing him as a companion. I was too disgusted with
myself to live and chopped wood to relieve my
feelings. After supper I hitched up Sandhelo and
drove to Spencer to post a letter. I am not in the
least sentimental&mdash;you know that&mdash;but all along
the road I kept seeing things that reminded me of
Justice Sherman and the fun we had had together.
Now that he was gone the days ahead of me seemed
suddenly very empty, and desolation laid a firm hand
on my ankle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Also, I had an uncomfortable recollection that it
was right along here we had met the horrid negro,
and I became filled with fear that I would meet him
again. The fear grew, and turned into absolute
panic when I approached that same clump of bushes
and in the dusk saw a figure rise from behind them
and lurch toward the road. I pulled Sandhelo up
sharply, thinking to turn around and flee in the opposite
direction, but Sandhelo refused to be turned.
When I pulled him up he sat back and mixed up the
harness so he got the bit into his teeth, and then he
jumped up and went straight on forward, with a
squeal of mischief. When we were opposite the
figure in the road Sandhelo stopped short and poked
his nose forward just the way he used to do when
Justice Sherman came into his stall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; said a voice in the darkness, and then
I saw that the figure in the road was Justice Sherman.
His bad ankle had given out on him and he
had been sitting there on the ground waiting for
some vehicle to come along and give him a lift to
Spencer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get in,&rdquo; I said briefly, helping him up, and he
got in beside me without a word. We drove to
Spencer in silence and he made no move to get out
when we got there. I mailed my letter and then
turned and drove homeward. About half way home
he spoke up and apologized for being so hasty, and
wondered if father would take him back again. I
reassured him heartily and we were on the old footing
of intimacy by the time we reached home.</p>
<p>We found father standing in front of the house
talking to a negro whom we recognized as the one
we had met in the road that afternoon. Father
greeted Justice Sherman with joy and relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You pretty nearly came back too late,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Here I was just hiring a man to take your place.&rdquo;
Then he turned to the negro and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all off,
Solomon. I don&rsquo;t need you. My own man has come
back. You go along and get a job somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The negro shuffled off and I fancied that he looked
rather resentful at being sent away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; I said, when the creature was out of
earshot, &ldquo;you surely weren&rsquo;t going to hire that ape
to work here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; answered father. &ldquo;I have to have
a man to help with the horses, and this fellow came
up to the door and asked for work, so I promised
him a job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s such a terrible looking thing,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Father only laughed and dismissed the subject
with a wave of his hands. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t hiring him for
his looks,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;He said he could handle
horses and that was enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Justice Sherman came back to us and the subject
of military service was never broached again.</p>
<p>About a week after his return, and when Jim
Wiggin was able to be about again, Justice Sherman
walked into the kitchen with a mincing air
quite unlike his ordinary free stride. He had been
to Spencer for the mail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tread softly when you see me,&rdquo; he advised.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a perfessor, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked up inquiringly from the potato I was
paring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold in me,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;the entire faculty
of the Spencer High School. I am instructor in
Latin, Greek, mathematics, science, history, English
and dramatics; also civics and economics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean really?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Really and truly, for sartain sure,&rdquo; he repeated.
&ldquo;The last faculty got drafted and left the school
in a bad way. I heard about it down at the post-office
this afternoon and went over and applied for
the job. The hardened warriors that compose the
school board fell for me to a man. I recited one
line of Latin and they applauded to the echo; I recited
a line of gibberish and told them it was Greek,
and they wept with delight at the purity of my accent.
Then they cautiously inquired if I was qualified
to teach any other branches and I told them
that I also included in my repertoire cooking, dressmaking
and millinery. This last remark was intended
to be facetious, but those solemn old birds
took it seriously and forthwith broke into loud hosannas.
I was somewhat mystified at the outbreak
until I gathered from bits of conversation that the
extravagant township of Spencer had intended to
hire two high school teachers this year, as the last
incumbent&rsquo;s accomplishments had been rather brief
and fleeting, but what was the use, as one pious old
hairpin by the name of Butts delicately put it, what
was the use of paying two teachers when one feller
could do the hull thing himself? Then he shook me
feelingly by the hand and said he knowed I was a
bargain the minute he laid eyes on me. O Tempora,
O Mores! Papers were brought and shoved into
my yielding hands, the writ duly executed, and I
passed out of the door a fully fledged &lsquo;perfessor&rsquo;
with a six-months&rsquo; contract. Smile on me, please,
I&rsquo;m a bargain!&rdquo; And he danced a hornpipe in the
middle of the floor until the dishes rattled in the
cupboard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>I stared at him speechless. He teach high school?
And the things he mentioned as being able to teach!
History, French, mathematics, physics, literature,
philosophy, Latin, Greek! Quite a well-rounded
sheep herder, this! The mystery about him deepened.
It was clear now that he was a college graduate.
Again I revised my estimate as to his age,
and decided he must be about twenty-three or four.
Why would he be willing to teach a farce of a high
school like the one in Spencer?</p>
<p>Then in the midst of my puzzling it came over me
that I did not want him to leave us, and that I would
miss him terribly. Of course, he would go to live
in Spencer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to board with any of the school
board?&rdquo; I asked jealously, that being what the last
&ldquo;faculty&rdquo; had done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Board with the Board?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Neat expression,
that. Not that I know of. I haven&rsquo;t been
requested to vacate my present quarters yet, or do
I understand that you are even now serving notice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thrill of joy shot through me. Maybe he would
still live in the little cabin on our farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of course you would rather live near
the school,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s six miles from here. Why
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I would dwell with thee, merry grasshopper,&rsquo;&rdquo;
he quoted. &ldquo;That is, if I am kindly permitted to do
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so we settled it. He is to ride with Sandhelo
in the cart every day as far as my school, then
drive on to Spencer, and stop for me on the way
home. What fun it is going to be!</p>

<h3>SAHWAH TO KATHERINE</h3>
<p><span class="date">Nov. 10, 19&mdash;.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Darling K:</span></p>
<p>This big old town is like the Deserted Village
since you and the other Winnies went away. For
the first few weeks it was simply ghastly; there
wasn&rsquo;t a tree or a telephone pole that didn&rsquo;t remind
me of the good times we used to have. Do you
realize that I am the sole survivor of our once large
and lusty crew? Migwan and Hinpoha and Gladys
are at Brownell; Veronica is in New York; Nakwisi
has gone to California with her aunt; Medmangi
is in town, but she is locked up in a nasty
old hospital learning to be a doctor in double quick
time so she can go abroad with the Red Cross.
Nothing is nice the way it used to be. I like to go
to Business College, of course, and there are lots of
pleasant girls there, but they aren&rsquo;t my Winnies.
I get invited to things, and I go and enjoy myself
after a fashion, but the tang is gone. It&rsquo;s like ice
cream with the cream left out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>I went to the House of the Open Door one Saturday
afternoon and poked around a bit, but I didn&rsquo;t
stay very long; the loneliness seemed to grab hold
of me with a bony hand. Everything was just the
way we had left it the night of our last Ceremonial
Meeting&mdash;do you realize that we never went out
after that? There was the candle grease on the
floor where Hinpoha&rsquo;s emotion had overcome her
and made her hand wobble so she spilled the melted
wax all out of her candlestick. There were the
scattered bones of our Indian pottery dish that you
knocked off the shelf making the gestures to your
&ldquo;Wotes for Wimmen&rdquo; speech. There was the Indian
bed all sagged down on one side where we had
all sat on Nyoda at once.</p>
<p>It all brought back last year so plainly that it
seemed as if you must everyone come bouncing out
of the corners presently. But you didn&rsquo;t come, and
by and by I went down the ladder to the Sandwiches&rsquo;
Lodge. That was just as bad as our nook upstairs.
The gym apparatus was there, just as it used to be,
with the mat on the floor where they used to roll
Slim, and beside it the wreck of a chair that Slim had
sat down on too suddenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>Poor Slim! He tried to enlist in every branch
of the service, but, of course, they wouldn&rsquo;t take
him; he was too fat. He starved himself and drank
vinegar and water for a week and then went the
rounds again, hoping he had lost enough to make
him eligible, and was horribly cut up when he found
he had gained instead. He was quite inconsolable
for a while and went off to college with the firm
determination to trim himself down somehow. Captain
has gone to Yale, so he can be a Yale graduate
like his father and go along with him to the class
reunions. Munson McKee has enlisted in the navy
and the Bottomless Pitt in the Ambulance Corps.
The rest of the Sandwiches have gone away to
school, too.</p>
<p>The boards creaked mournfully under my feet
as I moved around, and it seemed to me that the old
building was just as lonesome for you as I
was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be proud,&rdquo; I said aloud to the
walls, &ldquo;that you ever sheltered the Sandwich Club,
because now you are going to be honored above all
other barns,&rdquo; and I hung in the window the Service
Flag with the two stars that I had brought with me.
It looked very splendid; but it suddenly made the
place seem strange and unfamiliar. Here was something
that did not belong to the old days. It is so
hard to realize that the boys who used to wrestle
around here have gone to war.</p>
<p>I went out and closed the door, but outside I
lingered a minute to look sadly up at the little window
in the end where the candle always used to burn
on Ceremonial nights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, House of the Open Door,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve had lots of good times in you and nobody
can ever take them away from us. We&rsquo;ve got to
stop playing now for awhile and Glorify Work.
We&rsquo;re going to do our bit, and you must do yours,
too, by standing up proudly through all winds and
weather and showing your service flag. Some day
we&rsquo;ll all come back to you, or else the Winnebago
spirit will come back in somebody else, and you must
be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said good-bye to the House of the Open Door
with the hand sign of fire and a military salute, and
went away feeling a heavy sense of responsibility,
because in all this big lonely city I was the only one
left to uphold the honor of the Winnebagos.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>And hoop-la! I did it, too, all by myself. The
week after I had paid the visit to the House of the
Open Door someone called me on the telephone and
wanted to know if this was Miss Sarah Brewster
who belonged to the Winnebago Camp Fire Girls,
and when I said yes it was the voice informed me
that she was Mrs. Lewis, the new Chief Guardian
for the city, and President of the Guardians&rsquo; Association.
She went on to say that she wanted to plan
a patriotic parade for all the Camp Fire Girls in the
city to take part in, and as part of the ceremony to
present a large flag to the city. She knew what she
wanted all right, but she wasn&rsquo;t sure that she could
carry it out, and as she had seen the Winnebagos
the time they took part in the Fourth of July pageant,
she wanted to know if we would take hold and
help her manage the thing. I started to tell her that
the Winnebagos weren&rsquo;t here and couldn&rsquo;t help her;
then I reflected that I, at least, was left and it was
up to me to do what you all would have done if you
had been here. So I said yes, I&rsquo;d be glad to take
hold and help make the parade a success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>And, believe me, it was! Can you guess how
many girls marched? <i>Twenty-three hundred!</i>
Glory! I didn&rsquo;t know there were so many girls in
the whole world! The line stretched back until you
couldn&rsquo;t see the end, and still they kept on coming.
And who do you suppose led the parade? Why, <i>I</i>
did, of all people! And on a <i>horse</i>! Carrying the
Stars and Stripes on a long staff that fitted into a
contrivance on the saddle to hold it firm. Right in
front of me marched the Second Regiment Band,
and my horse pawed the ground in time to the music
until I nearly burst with excitement. After me came
the twenty girls, all Torch Bearers, who carried the
big flag we were going to present to the city, and
behind them came the floats and figures of the pageant.</p>
<p>I must tell you about some of these, and a few of
them you&rsquo;ll recognize, because they are our old
stunts trimmed up to suit the occasion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>GIVE SERVICE was the most impressive, because
it is the most important just now. It was in
twelve parts, showing all the different ways in which
Camp Fire Girls could serve the nation in the great
crisis. There was the Red Cross Float, showing the
girls making surgical dressings and knitting socks
and sweaters. Another showed them making clothes
for themselves and for other members of the family
to cut down the hiring of extra help; and similar
floats carried out the same idea in regard to cooking,
washing and ironing. Yes ma&rsquo;am! Washing and
ironing! You don&rsquo;t need to turn up your nose. One
float was equipped with a complete modern household
laundry and the girls on it had their sleeves
rolled up to their elbows and were doing up fine
waists and dresses in great shape, besides operating
electric washing machines and mangles.</p>
<p>One float was just packed full of good things
which the girls had cooked without sugar, eggs or
white flour, and with fruits and vegetables which
they had canned and preserved themselves, while
the fertile garden in which said fruits and vegetables
had grown came trundling on behind, the girls
armed with spades, hoes and rakes. I consumed
two sleepless nights and several strenuous afternoons
accomplishing that garden on wheels and I
want you to know it was a work of art. The plants
were all artificial, but they looked most lifelike, indeed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>Besides those things we had groups of girls taking
care of children so their mothers could go out and
work; and teaching foreign girls how to take care
of their own small brothers and sisters, so they&rsquo;ll
grow up strong and healthy.</p>
<p>There really seemed to be no end to our usefulness.</p>
<p>Behind the wheeled portion of the parade came
hundreds of girls on foot, carrying pennants that
stretched clear across the street, with clever slogans
on them like this:</p>
<p class="center">DON&rsquo;T FORGET US, UNCLE SAMMY,
<br />WE&rsquo;RE ALWAYS ON THE JOB
<br /><span class="gs">*    *    *    *    *    *</span>
<br />YOU&rsquo;RE HERE BECAUSE WE&rsquo;RE HERE
<br /><span class="gs">*    *    *    *    *    *</span>
<br />AND THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING!
<br /><span class="gs">*    *    *    *    *    *</span>
<br />WE ARE PROUD TO LABOR FOR OUR COUNTRY</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>And the people! Oh, my stars! They lined the
streets for thirty blocks, packed in solid from the
store fronts to the curb. And the way they cheered!
It made shivers of ecstasy chase up and down my
spine, while the tears came to my eyes and a big
lump formed in my throat. If you&rsquo;ve never heard
thousands of people cheering at you, you can&rsquo;t imagine
how it feels.</p>
<p>One time when the procession halted at a cross
street I saw a fat old man, who I&rsquo;m sure was a dignified
banker, balancing himself on a fireplug so
he could see better, and waving his hat like crazy.
He finally got so enthusiastic that he fell off the
fireplug and landed on his hands and knees in the
gutter, where some Boy Scouts picked him up and
dusted him off, still feebly waving his hat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>Our line of march eventually brought us out at
Lincoln Square, where the presentation of the flag
was to take place. We stood in the shadow of the
Lincoln Memorial monument, and who do you suppose
presented the flag? Me again. In the name of
all the Camp Fire Girls of the city, I ceremoniously
presented it to the Mayor, who accepted it with a
flowery speech that beat mine all hollow. Besides
presenting the flag I was to help raise it. The pole
was there already; it had seen many flag raisings in
its long career and many flags had flapped themselves
to shreds on its top. The thing I had to do was
fasten our flag to the ropes and pull her up. In this
I was to be assisted by a soldier brother of one of
the girls who was home on furlough. He was to be
standing there at the pole waiting for us, but when
the time came he wasn&rsquo;t there. Where he was I
hadn&rsquo;t the slightest idea; nor did I have any time to
spend wondering. Mrs. Lewis had set her heart on
having a man in soldier&rsquo;s uniform help raise the flag;
it added so much to the spirit of the occasion. Just
at this moment I saw a man in army uniform standing
in the crowd at the foot of the monument, very
close to me. Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation I beckoned
him imperatively to me. He came and I
thrust the rope into his hands, whispering directions
as to what he was to do. It all went without
a hitch and the crowd never knew that he wasn&rsquo;t the
soldier we had planned to have right from the start.
We pulled evenly together and the flag slowly unfolded
over our heads and went fluttering to the
top, while the band crashed out the &ldquo;Star Spangled
Banner.&rdquo; It was glorious! If I had been thrilled
through before, I was shaken to my very foundations
now. I felt queer and dizzy, and felt myself
making funny little gaspy noises in my throat.
There was a great cheer from the crowd and the
ceremonies were over. The parade marched on to
the Armory, where we were to listen to an address
by Major Blanchard of the &mdash;th Engineers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>The girls had all filed in and found seats when
Mrs. Lewis, who was to introduce Major Blanchard,
came over to me where I was standing near the
stage and said in a tragic tone, &ldquo;Major Blanchard
couldn&rsquo;t come; I&rsquo;ve had a telegram. What on earth
are we going to do? He was going to tell stories
about camp life; the girls will be <i>so</i> disappointed
not to hear him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I rubbed my forehead, unable to think of anything
that would meet the emergency. An ordinary
speaker wouldn&rsquo;t fill the bill at all, I knew,
when the girls all had their appetites whetted for a
Major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might ask the band to give a concert, and all
of us sing patriotic songs,&rdquo; I ventured finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything else to do,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lewis,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> disappointed not to have the Major here.
The girls are all crazy to hear about the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>Just then I caught sight of a uniform outside of
the open entrance way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the soldier who
helped us raise the flag, standing outside the door.
Maybe he&rsquo;ll come in and talk to the girls in place of
the Major.&rdquo; I hurried out and buttonholed the soldier.
He declined at first, but I wouldn&rsquo;t take no
for an answer. I literally pulled him in and chased
him up the aisle to the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t make a speech,&rdquo; he said in an agonized
whisper, as we reached the steps of the stage,
trying to pull back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to,&rdquo; I answered cheerfully. &ldquo;Speeches
are horrid bores, anyway. Just tell them exactly
what you do in camp; that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re crazy
to hear about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lewis didn&rsquo;t tell the audience that the
speaker was one I had kidnapped in a moment of
desperation. She introduced him as a friend of the
Major&rsquo;s, who had come to speak in his place. The
applause when she introduced him was just as hearty
as if he had been the Major himself. The fact that
he was a soldier was enough for the girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>And he brought down the house! He wasn&rsquo;t an
educated man, but he was very witty, and had the
gift of telling things so they seemed real. He told
little intimate details of camp life from the standpoint
of the private as the Major never could have
told them. He had us alternately laughing and
crying over the little comedies and tragedies of barracks
life. He imitated the voices and gestures of
his comrades and mimicked the officers until you
could see them as plainly as if they stood on the
stage. He talked for an hour instead of the half
hour the Major was scheduled to speak and when
he stopped the air was full of clamorings for more.
Private Kittredge had made more of a hit than
Major Blanchard could have done.</p>
<p>I never saw a person look so astonished or so
pleased as he did at the ovation which followed his
speech. He stood there a moment, looking down at
the audience with a wistful smile, then he got fiery
red and almost ran off the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether to be glad or sorry the
Major&rsquo;s not coming,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Lewis to me
under cover of the applause. &ldquo;The Major&rsquo;s a very
fine speaker, but he wouldn&rsquo;t have made such a
<i>human</i> speech. You certainly have a knack of picking
out able people, Miss Brewster! You chose just
the right girls for each part in the pageant.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t acknowledge this compliment as I should
have, because I was wondering why our soldier man
had looked that way when we applauded him. He
would have slipped out of the side door when he
came off the stage, but I stopped him and made him
wait for the rest of the program. A national fraternity
was holding a convention in town that week
and members from all the great colleges were in attendance.
As it happened, our Major is a member
of that fraternity, and, as a mark of esteem for the
Camp Fire Girls, he asked the fraternity glee club
to sing for us at the close of our patriotic demonstration.</p>
<p>The singers came frolicking in from some banquet
they had been attending, in a very frisky mood, and
sang one funny song after another until our sides
ached from laughing. I stole a glance now and then
at Private Kittredge, beside me, but he never noticed.
He was drinking in the antics of those carefree
college boys with envious, wistful eyes. At the
end of their concert the singers turned and faced the
great flag that hung down at the back of the stage
and sang an old college song that we had heard sung
before, but which had suddenly taken on a new, deep
meaning. With their very souls in their voices they
sang it:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Red is for Harvard in that grand old flag,</p>
<p class="t0">Columbia can have her white and blue;</p>
<p class="t0">And dear old Yale will never fail</p>
<p class="t0">To stand by her color true;</p>
<p class="t0">Penn and Cornell amid the shot and shell</p>
<p class="t0">Were fighting for that torn and tattered rag,</p>
<p class="t0">And our college cheer will be</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;My Country, &lsquo;tis of Thee,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">And Old Glory will be our college flag!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The effect was electrical. Everybody cheered
until they were hoarse. I looked at Private Kittredge.
His head was buried in his hands and the
tears were trickling out between his fingers. I was
too much embarrassed to say anything, and I just
sat looking at him until, all of a sudden, he sat up,
and reaching out his hand he caught hold of mine
and squeezed it until it hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back,&rdquo; he said brokenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Going back?&rdquo; I repeated, bewildered. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to camp,&rdquo; he replied. Then he began to
speak in a low, husky voice. &ldquo;I want to tell you
something,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not what you think I am.
I&rsquo;m a deserter. That is, I would have been by tomorrow.
My leave expires to-night. I wasn&rsquo;t going
back. I didn&rsquo;t want to go into the army. I didn&rsquo;t
want to fight for the country. I hated the United
States. It had never given me a square deal. My
father was killed in a factory when I was a baby
and my mother never got a cent out of it. She
wasn&rsquo;t strong and she worked herself to death trying
to support herself and me. I grew up in an
orphan asylum where everybody was down on me
and made me do all the unpleasant jobs, and at
twelve I was adrift in the world. I sold papers in
the streets and managed to make a living, but one
night I went out with a crowd of boys and some
of the older ones knocked a man down and stole
his money and the police caught the whole bunch
and we were sent to the Reformatory. After that I
had a hard time trying to make an honest living
because people don&rsquo;t like to hire anyone that&rsquo;s been
in the Reformatory. I never had any fun the way
other boys did. I had to live in cheap boarding
places because I didn&rsquo;t earn much and nobody that
was decent seemed to care to associate with me. I
was sick of living that way and wanted to go away
to South America where no one would know about
the Reformatory, and make a clean start. Then I
was drafted. I hated army life, too. All the other
fellows got mail and boxes from home and had a
big fuss made over them and I didn&rsquo;t have a soul
to write to me or send me things. I was given a
good deal of kitchen duty to do and everybody looks
down on that. I kept getting sorer and sorer all the
time and at last I decided to desert. I got a three-days&rsquo;
leave and made up my mind that I wouldn&rsquo;t go
back. I was just hanging around the street killing
time this afternoon when I saw a crowd and stopped
to see what the excitement was about. Then all of
a sudden you looked at me and motioned me to come
over and help you raise the flag. It was the first time
I had ever touched the Stars and Stripes. When the
folds fell around my shoulders before she went sailing
up, something wakened in me that I had never
felt before. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it was I, standing
there raising the flag with all those people cheering.
It intoxicated me and carried me along with the
parade when it went to the armory. Then again,
like the hand of fate, you came out and pulled me in
and made me speak to the girls. I had never spoken
before anyone in my life. I had never &lsquo;been in&rsquo;
anything. It made another man of me. All of a
sudden I found I did love my country after all. I
<i>did</i> have something to fight for. I <i>did</i> belong somewhere.
It <i>did</i> thrill me to see Old Glory fluttering
out in the wind. That was my country&rsquo;s flag, <i>my</i>
flag. I was willing to die for it. I&rsquo;m going back to
camp to-night,&rdquo; he finished simply.</p>
<p>I gripped his hands silently, too moved to
speak.</p>
<p>All the while we were talking there the crowd
had been busy getting their things together and going
out and nobody paid any attention to us sitting
there in the shadow under the gallery. Now, however,
I was aware of somebody approaching directly,
and along came the Mayor, gracious and smiling, to
shake hands with the speaker of the afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those were rattling good stories you told,&rdquo; he
said in his hearty way. &ldquo;I say, won&rsquo;t you be a guest
at a little dinner the frat brothers are giving this
evening, and tell them to the boys? That&rsquo;s the kind
of stuff everybody&rsquo;s interested in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>And off went the man who had never had a
chance, arm in arm with the Mayor, to be guest of
honor at a dinner in the finest hotel in the city!</p>
<p>Jiminy! Do you see what the Winnebagos have
gone and done? They&rsquo;ve saved a man from being
a deserter! I&rsquo;ve promised to write to him and get
the rest of the girls to write and send him things,
and I&rsquo;ll bet that he&rsquo;ll be loyal to the flag to the last
gasp.</p>
<p>Now aren&rsquo;t you glad you&rsquo;re a Winnebago?</p>

<h3>KATHERINE TO THE WINNEBAGOS</h3>
<p><span class="date">Nov. 15, 19&mdash;.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Dearest Winnebagos:</span></p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t happen to know of anyone that would
like to employ a good country schoolma&rsquo;am for the
rest of the term, do you? I&rsquo;m fired; that is, I&rsquo;ll
wager all my earthly possessions that I will be at the
next session of the Board. The prophet hath spoken
truly; and you can&rsquo;t make a silk-purse-carrying
schoolmarm out of Katherine Adams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>This morning I woke up with a glouch, which is
a combination of a gloom and a grouch, and worse
than either. It didn&rsquo;t improve it to have to go to
school on such a crisp, cool, ten-mile-walk day and
listen to Clarissa Butts stammer out a paragraph in
the reader about vegetation around extinct volcanoes,
and all the while trying to keep my eye on the
rest of the pupils, who were not listening, but throwing
spitballs at each other. The worst of it was
I didn&rsquo;t blame them a bit for not listening. Why
on earth can&rsquo;t they put something interesting into
school readers? Even I, with my insatiable thirst
for information, gagged on vegetation around extinct
volcanoes. Clarissa&rsquo;s paragraph drew to a
halting close and finally stopped with a rising inflection,
regardless of my oft-repeated instructions how
to behave in the presence of a period, and I had to
go through the daily process of correction, which
ended as usual with Clarissa in tears and me wondering
why I was born.</p>
<p>The next little girl took up the tale in a droning
sing-song that was almost as bad as Clarissa&rsquo;s halting
delivery, and fed the Glouch until he was twice
his original size. The climax came when Absalom
Butts, by some feat of legerdemain, pulled the bottom
out of his desk and his books suddenly fell to
the floor with a crash that shattered the nerves of
the entire class. Absalom and some of the other
boys snickered out loud; the girls looked at me with
anxious expectancy.</p>
<p>I sat up very straight. &ldquo;Class attention!&rdquo; I commanded,
rapping with my ruler. &ldquo;Close books and
put them away,&rdquo; I ordered next.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Books and papers made a fluttering disappearance,
through which the long-drawn sniffs of Clarissa
Butts were plainly audible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get your hats and form in line for dismissal,&rdquo;
was the next order that fell on their startled ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to send us home,&rdquo; came to my hearing
in a sibilant whisper. Clarissa&rsquo;s sniffs became
gurgling sobs as she took her place in the apprehensive
line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward march, and halt outside the door!&rdquo; I
drove them out like sheep before me and then I
came out and banged the door shut with a vicious
slam. Passing between the two files I divided the
ranks into sheep and goats, left and right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Class attention!&rdquo; I called again. &ldquo;Do you all
see that dark spot over there?&rdquo; said I, pointing to the
dim line of trees that marked the beginning of
the woods, some seven miles distant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Adams,&rdquo; came the wondering
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;the left half of the line will
take the road around Spencer way, and the right
half will take the road around the other way, and
the half that gets there last will have to give a show
to amuse the winners. We&rsquo;re going to have a hike,
and a picnic. You all have your lunch baskets,
haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>For a minute they stood dazed, looking at me as
if they thought I had lost my senses. Clarissa
stopped short in the middle of a sob to gape open-mouthed.
Come to think of it, I don&rsquo;t believe she
ever did finish that sob. I repeated my directions,
and taking the youngest girl by the hand I started
one half of the line down the road, calling over my
shoulder to the other line that they might as well
make up their stunts on the way, because they were
going to get beaten. But after all it was our side
that got there last, because we were mostly girls and
I had to carry the littlest ones over some of the
rough places.</p>
<p>I sent the boys to gather wood and built up a big
fire, and then I proceeded to initiate the crowd into
some of the mysteries of camp cookery. I daubed a
chicken with clay and baked it with the feathers on,
like we used to do last summer on Ellen&rsquo;s Isle, and
it would have been splendid if it hadn&rsquo;t been for one
small oversight. I forgot to split the chicken open
and take the insides out before I put the clay on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>After dinner it was up to me to produce a show
in obedience to my own mandate. None of the rest
on my side could help me out, because not one of the
blessed chicks had ever done a &ldquo;stunt&rdquo; in their
lives. The only &ldquo;prop&rdquo; I had was a bright red tie,
so I proceeded to do the stunt about the goat that
ate the two red shirts right off the line&mdash;you remember
the way Sahwah used to bring the house down
with it? Well, I had just got to the part where &ldquo;he
heard the whistle; was in great pain&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and, accompanying
the action to the music, was down on
all fours giving a lifelike imitation of a goat tied to
a railroad track, while the delighted boys and girls
were doubled up in all stages of mirth, when I heard
a sound that resembled the last gasp of a dying elephant.
I jumped to my feet and whirled around,
and there in the offing were anchored&mdash;anchored is
the only expression that fits because they were literally
rooted to the spot&mdash;the entire school board of
Spencer township, plus two strange men plus Justice
Sherman. The board members and the strangers
stood with their jaws dropped down on their chests
and their eyes popping out of their heads; Justice
had his handkerchief over his mouth and was shaking
from head to foot like a sapling in a high wind.
I gave a gasp of dismay which resulted in further
developments, for I had the whole red tie stuffed
into my mouth with which to flag the train when the
time came, and the minute I opened my mouth it billowed
out in the breeze. That was the finishing
touch. I might have explained away the quadruped
attitude as a gymnastic pose, but it takes considerable
of an artist to explain away a mouthful of red tie
in a schoolmarm. Besides that, I was mud from
head to foot, having slid about ten feet for the
home plate in a baseball game we had before dinner,
so that I presented a front elevation in natural clay
effect, broken here and there with elderberries in
bas-relief, which had adhered when the can was accidentally
spilled over me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>Being acutely conscious of all these facts in every
corner of my anatomy did not add to my ease of
manner, but I said as nonchalantly as I could, &ldquo;How
do you do, Mr. Butts? How do you do, gentlemen?&rdquo;
Then I added rather lamely, &ldquo;Pleasant day,
is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Butts exploded into the same sort of snort
as had interrupted me in time to prevent the goat
from flagging the train.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Adams,&rdquo; he said severely, when he had recovered
his breath sufficiently to speak, &ldquo;what does
this mean? Why ain&rsquo;t you teaching school to-day?
Here comes these here two fellers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and he
jerked his thumb in the direction of the two
strangers&mdash;&ldquo;from the new school board over to
Sabot Junction, to visit our school, and I takes them
over to the schoolhouse and finds it empty and no
sign of you or the class. Fine doin&rsquo;s, them! These
fellers had their trip for nothin&rsquo; and they were pretty
mad about it I can tell you, and so I thinks I&rsquo;ll drive
them over to Kenridge to the schoolhouse there and
here on the way I runs into you in the woods, acting
like a lunytic. I always said Bill Adams&rsquo;s daughter
was plumb crazy and now I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stood aghast. How was I to explain to an irate
school board that neither I nor the children had felt
like going to school to-day and had decided to have
a picnic instead, and that the &ldquo;lunytic actin&rsquo;s&rdquo; was
Sahwah&rsquo;s famous stunt, enacted to add to the hilarity
of the occasion? I threw an appealing glance at
Justice Sherman, and he sobered up enough to speak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand, Mr. Butts,&rdquo; he said hastily.
&ldquo;Miss Adams <i>is</i> teaching school to-day. She is
teaching the children botany and it is sometimes
necessary to go out into the woods and study right
from Nature. I heard her say that she was going
to take the children out the first fine day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was outrageous fibbing, but nobly done in a
good cause. It was of no avail, however, for Absalom
Butts promptly called out importantly, &ldquo;It
ain&rsquo;t either no botany class; it&rsquo;s a picnic. She made
us put our books away when we didn&rsquo;t want to and
come out here.&rdquo; And he made an impudent grimace
at me, accompanied with the usual taunting grin.</p>
<p>Right here I had another surprise of my young
life. No sooner had the craven Absalom turned
state&rsquo;s evidence when there rose from the masses an
unexpected champion. As Elijah Butts began to express
his opinion of my &ldquo;carryin&rsquo;s on&rdquo; in no veiled
terms, his daughter Clarissa, developing a hitherto
undreamed of amount of spirit, suddenly threw her
arms around my waist and stood there stamping her
feet with anger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t a lunatic, she ain&rsquo;t a lunatic,&rdquo; she
shrilled above her father&rsquo;s gruff tones, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s nice
and I love her!&rdquo; After which astounding confession
she melted into tears and stood there sobbing
and hugging the breath out of me. To my greater
astonishment all the other girls immediately followed
suit and gathered around me with shielding
caresses, turning defiant faces to the upbraiding
school board members. The boys made themselves
very inconspicuous in the rear, but I caught more
than one glowering look cast in the direction of Absalom.</p>
<p>Before this demonstration of affection, Mr. Butts
paused in astonishment, and, having hesitated, was
lost. He felt he was no longer cock of the walk,
and in dignified silence led the way to the surrey
standing in the road, with the rest of the school
board members and the visitors stalking after. I
watched them climb in and drive away, and then the
reaction set in and I sat down on the ground and
laughed until I cried, while the girls, not sure
whether I was laughing or crying, alternately giggled
convulsively and soothingly bade me &ldquo;never
mind.&rdquo; I sat up finally and shook the hair out of
my eyes and then I discovered that Justice Sherman
had not departed with the rest of the delegation,
but was sitting on the ground not far away, still
shaking with laughter and wiping his eyes on a red-bordered
napkin that had strayed out of a lunch
basket. A sudden suspicion seized me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Justice,&rdquo; I cried severely, &ldquo;did you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I do what?&rdquo; he asked in a startled tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find out I was off on a picnic and bring the
Board down to visit me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Justice threw out his hands in a gesture of denial.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Thou canst not say I did it, never shake
thy gory locks at me,&rsquo;&rdquo; he declaimed feelingly.
&ldquo;Where did they come from? They dropped, fair
one, like the gentle rain from heaven, upon the place
beneath. They came first to my humble dispensary
of learning, anxious to show the visiting Solons what
a bargain they had captured, and listened feelingly
while I conducted a Latin lesson, which impressed
them so much they invited me to come along
while they gave you the &lsquo;once over.&rsquo; You never
saw such an expression in your life as there was on
the face of Mr. Butts when he arrived at your place
and found it empty. I will remember it to my dying
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what on earth <i>were</i> you doing when we
found you in the woods?&rdquo; he finished in a mystified
tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>Then I told him about Sahwah&rsquo;s goat that ate the
two red shirts right off the line, and again he
laughed until he was weak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some schoolma&rsquo;am you, for visiting committees
to make notes on!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m discharged, of course,&rdquo; I remarked, after a
moment&rsquo;s silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, maybe not,&rdquo; said Justice soothingly, as we
reached home, and he turned off to go to his
cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if I am,&rdquo; I cried savagely. &ldquo;I hate
that old Board so I wouldn&rsquo;t work for them another
day.&rdquo; And I stalked into the house with my head
in the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>But somehow, after I had eaten my supper and
begun to write this letter, I began to feel differently.
The way the girls stood up for me this afternoon
changed my whole attitude toward school teaching.
To find out that they actually loved me was the
biggest surprise I had ever had in my life. I had
hated them so thoroughly along with the school
teaching that it had never occurred to me that they
did not feel the same way toward me. I suddenly
hated myself for my impatience with their stupidity.
Of course they were stupid&mdash;how could they be
otherwise, poor, pitiful, ill-clad, overworked creatures,
coming from such homes as they did? I
stopped despising them and was filled only with pity
for the narrow, colorless lives they led. That afternoon
when they had told me, shyly and wistfully,
how much they enjoyed my teaching, I was filled
with guilty pangs, because I knew just how much
<i>I</i> had enjoyed it. That impromptu picnic had quite
won their hearts and broken down the barriers between
us, and the trouble it had gotten me into
crystallized their affection into expression. Now
the ice was broken, and I would be able to get more
out of them than ever before. The prospect of
teaching began to have compensations.</p>
<p>Then suddenly I remembered. I would be discharged
after the next meeting of the Board. I
would have no opportunity of getting better acquainted
with my pupils and leading them in the
pleasant paths of knowledge. Just when the drink
began to taste sweet I had to go and upset the
cup!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>And your Katherine, who had hated teaching the
poor whites so fiercely all these months, buried her
head on her arms and cried bitterly at the thought
of having to give it up!</p>
<p><span class="center">Yours, in tears,</span>
<br /><span class="author">Katherine.</span></p>

<h3>HINPOHA TO KATHERINE</h3>
<p><span class="date">Brownell College, Nov. 25, 19&mdash;.</span></p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pig.png" alt="Clumsy Line Drawing of a Pig" width="372" height="157" />
</div>
<p><span class="sc">Dearest Katherine:</span></p>
<p>At first glance I don&rsquo;t suppose you will recognize
this sweet little creature, but you ought to, seeing
you are his own mother. It&rsquo;s the Pig you drew
with your eyes shut in Glady&rsquo;s PIG BOOK last
year. Gladys brought the PIG BOOK along with
her and the other day we got it out and found your
poor little Piggy with the mournful inscription
under him, &ldquo;Where is My Wandering Pig To-night?&rdquo;
He looked so sad and lonesome we knew
he was simply pining away for you. His ink has
faded perceptibly and he is just a shadow of his
former emphatic self. Migwan looked at it and
said, &ldquo;What charade does it make you think of?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>It was just as plain as the nose on your face, and
we all shouted at once, &ldquo;Pork-you-pine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t bear to leave him there to die of
grief and longing, so we transferred him tenderly
to this letter and are sending him to his mumsey by
Special Delivery. We hope he will pick up immediately
upon arrival.</p>
<p>We had Lamb&rsquo;s <i>Dissertation on Roast Pig</i> in
Literature the other day and were asked to comment
upon it, and Agony wrote that she didn&rsquo;t think
much of a dissertation on Pig that was written by
a Lamb; she thought Bacon could have handled the
subject much better!</p>
<p>As ever, your
Hinpoha.</p>
<p>P. S. Here is Piggy&rsquo;s tail;
<img src="images/tail.png" alt="Line Drawing of Pig&rsquo;s Tail" width="58" height="39" />
we found it in a corner of the page after we had him transferred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<h3>KATHERINE TO THE WINNEBAGOS</h3>
<p><span class="date">Dec. 3, 19&mdash;.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Dear Winnies:</span></p>
<p>Hurray! I&rsquo;m not fired. Why, I wasn&rsquo;t I never
will be able to figure out, but it&rsquo;s so. A week after
the Picnic the Board sat, but not on me. For a
while I lived in hourly expectation of forcible eviction,
but nothing happened, and I heard from Justice,
who stands high in the favor of Elijah Butts
and gets inside information about school matters,
that nothing was going to be done about it. If
Justice had any further details he wouldn&rsquo;t divulge
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Justice is a queer chap. Although he talks nonsense
incessantly, you can get very little information
out of him. And the way he puts up with all
kinds of inconveniences without complaint is wonderful
to me. He must be accustomed to far
different surroundings, and yet from his attitude
you&rsquo;d think his little cabin out beyond the stables
was the one place on earth he&rsquo;d select for an abode.
He never even mentioned the fact that the roof
leaked badly until I went out there to fetch him and
discovered him on top patching it. Then I went
inside to see what else could be improved, and the
bare, tumble-down-ness of the place struck me forcibly.
Light shone through chinks in the walls, the
door sill was warped one way and the door another,
and there was no sign of the pane that had once been
in the window. It was simply a dilapidated cabin,
and made no pretence of being anything else. How
he could live in it was more than I could see. No
light at night but a kerosene lamp, no furniture except
what he himself had made from boards, boxes
and logs; no carpet on the rough, rotting floor.
Why did he choose to live in this cell when he might
have taken rooms with any of the school board
members over in Spencer?</p>
<p>It was on this occasion that I saw the rough board
table under the one window, strewn with pencils,
compasses and sheets of paper covered with strange
lines and figures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; I asked curiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, that amounts to anything,&rdquo; replied Justice,
with a queer, dry little laugh. &ldquo;Once I was
fool enough to believe that it did amount to something.&rdquo;
He swept the papers together and threw
them face downward on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it,&rdquo; I said coaxingly, scenting a
secret, possibly a clue to his past.</p>
<p>Justice stared out of the open door for a few
moments, his shoulders slumped into a discouraged
curve, his face moody and resentful. Then suddenly
he threw back his head and squared his shoulders.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;Only, once
I thought I had a brilliant idea, and tried to patent
it. Then I found out I wasn&rsquo;t as smart as I thought
I was, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you invent?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just an old electrical device&mdash;you probably
wouldn&rsquo;t understand the workings of it&mdash;to be used
in connection with wireless apparatus. It was a
thing for recording vibrations and by its use a deaf
man could receive wireless messages. I worked four
years perfecting it and then thought my fortune was
made. But nobody would back me on it. They all
laughed at the thing. I got so disgusted one day
that I threw the thing into the sad sea. Four
years&rsquo; work went up at one splash! That was the
end of my career as an inventor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>Poor Justice! I sympathized with him so hard
that I hardly knew what to say. I knew what that
failure must have meant to his proud, sensitive soul.
The first failure is always such a blow. It takes
considerable experience in failing to be able to do it
gracefully. I could see that he didn&rsquo;t want any voluble
sympathy from me and that it was such a sore
subject that he&rsquo;d rather not talk about it. I didn&rsquo;t
know what to say. Then my eye fell on the sheets
on the table. &ldquo;What are you inventing now?&rdquo; I
asked, to break the silence that was growing awkward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just working on bits of things,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;to
pass the time away. You can&rsquo;t experiment with
wireless now, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The confidences Justice had made to me almost
drove my errand out of my head. It was rather
breathless, this having a new side of him turn up
every little while. I returned to my original quest
for information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came for expert advice,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>Justice looked up inquiringly. &ldquo;Shoot,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose,&rdquo; I inquired in a perplexed tone,
&ldquo;that they&rsquo;d enjoy it just as much if the costumes
have to be imaginary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Justice&rsquo;s face suddenly became contorted.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;d probably enjoy wearing, ah&mdash;er imaginary
costumes if the weather is warm enough,&rdquo; he replied,
carefully avoiding my eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Justice Sherman!&rdquo; I exploded, laughing in spite
of myself. &ldquo;You know very well what I mean. I
mean can we have a Ceremonial Meeting in blue
calico and imagine it&rsquo;s Ceremonial costumes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Justice scratched his head. &ldquo;It depends upon how
much imagination &lsquo;we&rsquo; have,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Now,
for instance, I know someone not a hundred miles
from here who can imagine herself in her college
room when it&rsquo;s only make believe, and can do wonderful
work in French and mathematics. She&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough from you,&rdquo; I interrupted. &ldquo;The
matter is settled. We&rsquo;ll have a Ceremonial Meeting.
We&rsquo;ll pretend we&rsquo;ve gone traveling and have
left our Ceremonial dresses at home. We&rsquo;re a war-time
group, anyhow, and ought to do without
things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>There now! The secret is out! Your poor stick
of a Katherine is a real Camp Fire Guardian. I
wasn&rsquo;t going to tell you at first, but I&rsquo;m afraid I
will have to come to you for advice very often. I
have organized my girls into a group and they are
entering upon the time of their young lives. Make
the hand sign of fire when you meet us, and greet
us with the countersign, for we be of the same kindred.
Magic spell of Wohelo! By its power even
the poor spirited Hard-uppers have become sisters
of the incomparable Winnebagos. Wo-He-Lo for
aye! We are the tribe of Wenonah, the Eldest
Daughter, and our tepee is the schoolhouse.</p>
<p>Of course, as Camp Fire Groups go, we are a very
poor sister. We haven&rsquo;t any costumes, any headbands,
any honor beads, or any Camp Fire adornments
of any kind. I advanced the money to pay
the dues, and that was all I could afford. There
are so few ways of making money here and most
of the families are so poor that I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll
never have much to do with. But the girls are so
taken up with the idea of Camp Fire that it&rsquo;s a
joy to see them. In all their shiftless, drudging
lives it had never once occurred to them that there
was any fun to be gotten out of work. It&rsquo;s like
opening up a new world to them. Do you know, I&rsquo;ve
discovered why they never did the homework I
used to give to them. It&rsquo;s because they never had
any time at home. There were always so many
chores to do. Their people begrudged them the time
that they had to be in school and wouldn&rsquo;t hear of
any additional time being taken for lessons afterward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>As soon as I heard that I changed the lessons
around so they could do all their studying in school.
Besides that, I looked some of the schoolbooks in the
face and decided that they were hopelessly behind
the times, Elijah Butts to the contrary. They were
the same books that had been used in this section
for twenty-five years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the use,&rdquo; I said aloud to the spider
weaving a web across my desk, &ldquo;of teaching people
antiquated geography and cheap, incorrect editions
of history when the thing they need most is to learn
how to cook and sew and wash and iron so as to
make their homes livable? Why should they waste
their precious time reading about things that happened
a thousand years ago when they might be
taking an active part in the stirring history that is
being made every day in these times? Blind, stubborn,
moth-eaten old fogies!&rdquo; I exclaimed, shaking
my fist in the direction of Spencer, where the Board
sat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>Right then and there I scrapped the time-honored
curriculum and made out a truly Winnebago one.
It kept the fundamentals, but in addition it included
cooking, sewing, table setting, bed making, camp
cookery, singing of popular songs, folk dancing,
hiking and stunts. Yes sir, stunts! I teach them
stunts as carefully as I teach them spelling and arithmetic.
Can you imagine anyone who has never done
a stunt in all their lives?</p>
<p>We rigged up a cook stove inside the schoolhouse&mdash;if
you&rsquo;d ever see it! The stovepipe comes
down every day at the most critical moment. Besides
that we have a stone oven outside. Every single
day is a picnic. As all of us have to bring our
lunch we turned the noon hour into a cooking lesson,
and two different girls act as hostesses each
day. The boys bring the wood and do the rough
work and are our guests at dinner. They all behave
pretty well except Absalom Butts, who is given
to practical jokes. But as the rest of the boys side
in with me against him, he gets very little applause
for his pains and very little help in his mischief.
The noon dinners continue to be the chief attraction
at the little school at the cross roads. Hardly
anybody is ever absent now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>I arranged the new schedule so that while I am
teaching the girls the things which are of interest to
them alone the boys have something else to do that
appeals to them. I give them more advanced arithmetic,
and have worked out a system of honor marks
for those who do extra problems, with a prize promised
at the end of the year. Then I got hold of an
old copy of Dan Beard&rsquo;s <i>New Ideas for Boys</i> and
have turned them loose on that, letting them make
anything they choose, and giving credit marks according
to how well they accomplish it.</p>
<p>You see what a job I have ahead of me as a Camp
Fire Guardian? In order to teach my girls what
they must know to win honors, I have had to turn
the whole school system inside out, and then, because
I couldn&rsquo;t bear to leave the boys out in the cold
while the girls are having such a good time, I have
to keep thinking up things for them to do, too. It
stretches my ingenuity to the breaking point sometimes
to get everything in, and keep all sides even.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>One afternoon each week I have the girls give to
Red Cross work. Every Saturday I drive all the
way over to Thomasville, where the nearest Red
Cross headquarters branch is, for gauze to make
surgical dressings, returning the finished ones the
next week. Here&rsquo;s where dull-witted Clarissa Butts
outshines all the brighter girls. She can make those
dressings faster and better than any of us and her
face is fairly radiant while she is working on them.
I have made her inspector over the rest to see that
there are no wrinkles and no loose threads, and she
nearly bursts with importance. For once in her
life she is head of the class.</p>
<p>While they fold bandages I read to them about
what is going on in the war and what the Red Cross
is doing everywhere, and we have beautiful times.
The worst trouble around here is getting up to date
things to read. There isn&rsquo;t a library within fifty
miles and the only books we have are the few I can
manage to buy and those that Justice Sherman has.
Would you mind sending out a magazine once in a
while after you have finished reading it?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>We had our first ceremonial meeting last night in
blue calico instead of ceremonial gowns, but it
didn&rsquo;t make a mite of difference. We felt the magic
spell of it just the same and promised with all our
hearts to seek beauty and give service and all the
other things in the Wood Gatherers&rsquo; Desire. That
is the wonderful thing about Camp Fire. It makes
you have exactly the same feelings whether you learn
it in a mansion or in a shack, in an exclusive girls&rsquo;
school or in a third-rate country schoolhouse. If
Nyoda only could have seen us! Of all people to
whom I had expected to pass on the Torch, this
group of Arkansas Hard-Uppers would have been
the very last to occur to me. Was this what she
meant, I wonder?</p>

<h3>HINPOHA TO KATHERINE</h3>
<p><span class="date">Dec. 15, 19&mdash;.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Darling Katherine:</span></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no use talking, I can never be the same
again. My life is wrecked&mdash;ruined&mdash;blighted; my
heart is broken, my faith in Man shattered, but try
as I like I can&rsquo;t forget him. His image is graven
on my heart, and there it will be until I die. But
for all that, I hate him&mdash;hate him&mdash;hate him! I
don&rsquo;t want to be unpatriotic, but I do hope he gets
killed in the very first battle he&rsquo;s in. Then at least
<i>she</i> won&rsquo;t have him! But a few short weeks ago I
was a mere child, playing at life, a schoolgirl, carefree
and heedless, with no other thought in the world
beside winning the freshman basketball championship
and surviving midyear&rsquo;s; to-day I am a woman,
old in experience, having eaten the fruit of
the tree of knowledge and found it bitter as gall.
And I must bear it all alone, because if I told the
girls here they would laugh at me, and some would
be spiteful enough to be glad about it. But I have
to tell somebody or explode, and I know you will
neither laugh nor tell anybody, being a perfect
Tombstone on secrets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>It&rsquo;s really all Agony and Oh-Pshaw&rsquo;s fault anyway,
for being born. Not that that actually had
anything to do with it, but if they hadn&rsquo;t been born
they wouldn&rsquo;t have had any birthday, and if they
hadn&rsquo;t had any birthday they wouldn&rsquo;t have given
that box party to the LAST OF THE WINNEBAGOS
and I never would have met Captain Bannister.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>You will readily understand, Katherine, how I
burn to serve my country at a time like this. There
is nothing I would not do to save her from the
clutches of the enemy. It is all very well to say that
woman&rsquo;s part in the war is to knit socks and sweaters
and fold bandages and conserve the Food Supply,
for that is all that the average woman would be
capable of doing anyhow, but as for me, I know that
my part is to be a much more definite and a far
nobler one. Of course, I do all the other things,
too, along with the other Winnies and the whole
college, for that matter; joined the Patriotic League,
go to Red Cross two nights a week and go without
sugar and wheat as much as possible. When I
wrote and told Nyoda that I hadn&rsquo;t eaten one speck
of candy for three months except what was given
me and was sending the money I usually spent for
it to the Belgians, she said I ought to have the
Cross of the Legion of Honor, and that &ldquo;greater
love hath no man than this, that he give up the
craving of his stomach for his country.&rdquo; You see,
Nyoda understands perfectly what it means to have
an awful candy hunger gnawing at your vitals like
the vulture at the giant&rsquo;s liver and look the other
way when you go past a window full of your favorite
bon-bons. But somehow candy doesn&rsquo;t seem so
satisfying when you know there are little Belgian
and French children suffering from a much worse
gnawing than candy hunger, and usually dropping
the price of a box of bonbons into the Relief Fund
stops the craving almost as much as the bonbons
themselves would.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>But this is only doing what thousands of other
girls all over the country are doing and there isn&rsquo;t
any individual glory in it. What I long to do is
carry the message that saves the army from destruction,
or discover the spy at his nefarious work. If
only the chance would come for me to do something
like that I could die happy.</p>
<p>Agony and Oh-Pshaw&rsquo;s birthday celebration was
quite an event. We had luncheon first at the Golden
Dragon, a wonderful new Chinese restaurant that
was recently opened, and had chop suey and chow
main and other funny things in a little stall lit up
with a gorgeous blue and gold lantern. Of course,
after that luncheon and the funny toasts we made to
the long life and health of Agony and Oh-Pshaw,
we felt pretty frolicsome, and by the time we got
settled in our seats at the Opera House we were
ready to start something. Our seats were in the first
row of the balcony, center aisle, and very prominent.
I had my knitting along as usual, intending to do
a few rows between the acts. I always knit in public
places; it sets a good example to other people.
Besides, my new knitting bag is too sweet for anything.</p>
<p>I had just got started knitting in the intermission
between the first and second acts when the orchestra
began to play &ldquo;Over There,&rdquo; and Agony got an
inspiration. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all stand up,&rdquo; she whispered,
&ldquo;and see how many people will bite and stand up,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>So, stifling our giggles, we sprang promptly to
our feet and stood stiffly at attention. In less than
a minute more than half of the audience, not knowing
why they should stand up for that piece, but
blindly following our lead, gathered up their hats,
wraps and programs in their arms and dutifully
stood up. Then as soon as they were standing we
sat down and laughed at the poor dupes, who sat
down in a hurry when they saw us, looking terribly
foolish. I haven&rsquo;t seen anything so funny in a long
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop laughing,&rdquo; said Gladys, giving me a poke
with her elbow. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re shaking the seat so I&rsquo;m
getting seasick.&rdquo; But I couldn&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, Hinpoha, there goes your knitting,&rdquo;
said Migwan. &ldquo;Catch it, somebody!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>But it was too late. When we stood up I had laid
the sock and the ball of yarn on the broad, low rail
in front of us, and now the ball had rolled over
the edge and dropped down into the audience below,
right into the lap of a young man who was sitting
on the end seat. He looked up in great surprise and
everybody laughed. They just <i>roared</i>! There I
stood, leaning over the balcony, hanging on to the
sock for dear life and trying to keep it from raveling,
and there he stood down below holding onto
the ball, and plainly puzzled what to do with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw down the sock, silly,&rdquo; whispered Agony,
reaching over and pulling my sleeve. &ldquo;Do you think
he&rsquo;s going to throw up the ball?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I dropped the sock and the man caught it in his
other hand and stood there laughing, as he started
to wind up the yards and yards of yarn between the
ball and the sock. When he had it wound up he
brought it upstairs to me. I went out into the corridor
to get it. Then for the first time I got a good
look at the man. He was dressed in uniform and
wore an officer&rsquo;s cap. He was very tall and slim,
with black eyes and hair and a small black mustache.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, patriotic little knitting lady,&rdquo; he said, making
a deep bow and handing me my knitting. I
looked up into his handsome, smiling face, and little
needle points began pricking in my spine. His eyes
met mine, he smiled, blushed to the roots of his
hair and looked away. All in one instant I knew.
I had met my fate. This was my Man, my own.
I felt faint and light-headed and all I could see
was his black eyes shining like stars. His deep,
thrilling voice still rang in my ears. With another
low bow he turned to leave me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Bannister, at your service,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>I went back to my seat with my head swimming.
&ldquo;Patriotic little knitting lady,&rdquo; I found myself whispering
under my breath. The girls suddenly seemed
awfully young and silly as they sat there giggling at
me and at each other. My mind was above all such
childish things; it was soaring up in the blue realms
of true love. I was glad he was tall and thin. I
think fat girls should marry thin men, don&rsquo;t you?
And he was dark, too, just the right mate for redheaded
me. And he was a Captain in the army!
How the other girls would envy me! Some of them
had friends who were lieutenants and were quite
uppish about it, but none that I knew had a Captain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>Then at another thought my heart stood still.
Suppose he should be killed? I pictured myself in
deep mourning, wearing on my breast the medal he
had won for bravery, which with his dying breath
he had asked his comrades to send to &ldquo;my wife!&rdquo;
I couldn&rsquo;t help brushing away a tear then and was
quite bewildered when Agony poked me and wanted
to know if I wasn&rsquo;t ever going to make a move
to go home. The show was over and the people
were streaming out. I hadn&rsquo;t seen a bit of the last
two acts.</p>
<p>Down in the lobby I saw Him again. He was
standing by the door talking to another man in
uniform. How he stood out among all other men!
He was one out of a thousand. My heart beat to
suffocation and I couldn&rsquo;t raise my eyes. In a moment
more I must pass him. I tried to look straight
ahead, but something I couldn&rsquo;t resist drew my head
around and I turned and looked straight into his
eyes. He tilted back his head and gave me one long,
thrilling glance, raised his hand to his cap, then
blushed and looked down. Just then Gladys pulled
at my sleeve and dragged me over to some girls we
knew and we were swept out with the crowd to the
sidewalk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>I scarcely knew where I was going. My feet
walked along between Gladys and Migwan, but my
soul was in the clouds, listening to strains of
heavenly music, while the others squabbled over ice
cream flavors and who should stand treat after the
show. Ice cream! Ye gods! Who could eat ice
cream with their soul seething in love?</p>
<p>From that hour when I had looked into Captain
Bannister&rsquo;s eyes and read the truth in them, I was a
changed being. I listened in silence to the idle
chatter of the girls around me as we walked to and
from classes. Their souls were wrapped up in their
knitting, in their lessons, in their meals. Agony and
Oh-Pshaw were trying to learn a new and difficult
back dive and they talked of nothing else night and
day. They were constantly at me to come and try
it, too, but I sat loftily apart, hugging my delicious
secret. As it says in the poem we learned in literature
class:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;What were the garden bowers of Thebes to me?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Like Semele, I scorned the sports of mortals and
thought only of my Beloved. I didn&rsquo;t envy her a
bit because her Love was Jupiter. What was Jupiter
compared to Captain Bannister?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>Twice I had seen him since that day in the theater&mdash;had
spoken to him, in fact. He was stationed in
the recruiting office and one day I happened to be
walking past with old Professor Remie and he knew
him and stopped and talked and introduced me. As
if we needed any introduction! We chatted of commonplaces,
but all the while our eyes told volumes.
However, soul cannot speak to soul in a public recruiting
station where curious eyes are looking on.</p>
<p>I had an errand uptown every day after that.
Only once did I see him as I passed the recruiting
station, however. Then he was throwing out a
Socialist who had tried to stop the recruiting and he
didn&rsquo;t see me.</p>
<p>But the next day there came a perfectly huge
box of chocolates, addressed quaintly to &ldquo;Miss Bradford,
Somewhere in Purgatory.&rdquo; Inside the box
was a card which read:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The strand you dropped with careless art</p>
<p class="t0">Has wound itself around my heart.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Underneath was written &ldquo;Captain Bannister,&rdquo; in a
bold, masculine hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>I buried the chocolates in the depths of my shirtwaist
box where no profane eye could see them or
profane tooth bite into them. I didn&rsquo;t mean to be
selfish, but I just couldn&rsquo;t bear to pass <i>his</i> chocolates
around to the crowd and hear Agony&rsquo;s delighted
squeal as she dove into them,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, girls, have one on Hinpoha&rsquo;s latest
crush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Agony has absolutely no understanding of
affairs of the heart&mdash;everything is a &ldquo;crush&rdquo; to
her.</p>
<p>The chocolates were fine and I ate a great many
of them, thinking of my Captain all the while, and
wondering when I would see him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hinpoha, what on earth is the matter with you?&rdquo;
said Gladys that night. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t eat a bite of
supper and you&rsquo;re as pale as a ghost. Have you upset
your stomach again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I drew myself up haughtily. The idea! To call
this delicious turmoil in my bosom an upset stomach!
I was glad I looked pale. I am usually as red
as a beet. It was more in keeping with the way I
felt to be pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not myself,&rdquo; I replied loftily, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not
my stomach.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go to bed, honey,&rdquo; said Gladys, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll bring
you a glass of hot water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I curled up in bed with Captain Bannister&rsquo;s card
in my hand under the pillow. I was so happy I felt
dizzy. Gladys came back with the hot water and
made me drink it in spite of my protests, and,
strange to say, I felt much calmer after it.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I couldn&rsquo;t pin my mind down on
my lessons. I did such queer things that people
began to notice it. For instance, mild old Professor
Remie, the chemistry teacher, handed back my paper
one day after he had given us a written lesson on
the Atomic Theory, and inquired in a puzzled tone
if I had meant just what I wrote. I glanced at it
and blushed furiously when I realized that I had
written down some lines that had been running
through my head all day:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Why do I fearfully cling to thee, Maidenhood?</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis but a pearl to be cast in thy waves, O Love!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>Then one day the word went around that He was
coming to make a speech in the college chapel. How
my heart fluttered! I could hardly sit still in the
seat when he came out on the platform. It seemed
as if everyone could hear what my heart was saying.
Soon that deep voice of his was filling the room,
thrilling me with unearthly things. Again and
again his eyes sought mine, full of joyous recognition,
of love and longing. I smiled reassuringly,
trying to telegraph the message, &ldquo;Be patient, all will
be well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To myself I was singing, &ldquo;O Captain, my Captain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unknown to himself, I had seen him before he
came into chapel. I was stooping down in the
shadow of the gymnasium steps, tying my shoestring,
when he came along the walk and was met
by Dr. Thorn, our President. They stood there and
talked a minute and I heard Captain Bannister say
that he was going to Washington that afternoon on
the five o&rsquo;clock train and that he was going directly
from the college to the station. He carried a small
black handbag, which Dr. Thorn offered to relieve
him of, but he said no, he didn&rsquo;t want to leave it out
of his hand even for a minute, there were valuable
papers in it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>When he came out on the platform I noticed that
he had the bag with him. He set it down on the
table while he talked and never got very far away
from it. I looked at that bag with deep interest.
What was in it? Something terribly important, I
knew. I thrilled with pride that my Captain should
have such great things to look after, and longed to
be of service to him.</p>
<p>His speech came to an end all too soon for me,
who could have gone on listening for a week, and he
went out before the rest of us were dismissed. No
chance to speak to me or give me one word of farewell
for the brief separation; only one long, lingering
look between us that left me shaken to the soul.
Now I knew what the Poet meant when he spoke of
&ldquo;the troth of glance and glance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wandered around by myself after he had gone.
I didn&rsquo;t desire to speak to any of the girls or have
them speak to me. I just wanted to be by myself.
Roaming thus I came to the little rustic summerhouse
in the park behind the college buildings, and
stopped in to rest a moment. It was a lovely mild
day, not a bit like winter, and not too cold to sit in
a summerhouse and dream. I didn&rsquo;t sit down,
though. For on the bark-covered bench I spied
something that brought my heart up into my mouth.
It was Captain Bannister&rsquo;s bag. No doubt about it.
There was his name on a card tied to the handle.
How came it here? They must have shown him
around the grounds after his speech and in some way
he had put the bag down in here and then gone off
and forgotten it. How dreadful he would feel when
he found it out!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>My mind was made up in a minute. Here was a
real chance to &ldquo;Give Service.&rdquo; If I hurried I could
get down to the station and catch him before he got
on the train. I made sure from the watchman that
he had left the college grounds. I looked at my
wrist watch. It was quarter to five. Without a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation I picked up the bag and ran
out to the street. I caught a car right away and sank
down in a seat breathless, but easy in my mind, because
the station was only a ten minutes&rsquo; ride in the
car.</p>
<p>Then, of course, something had to happen. A
sand wagon was in the cartrack ahead of us and
the motorman jingled his bell so furiously that the
driver got excited and pulled the lever that dumped
the whole load of sand on the car track.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>I jumped out of the car and looked wildly up and
down the road to see if there was a taxi in sight.
There wasn&rsquo;t; nothing but a motor truck from the
glue factory. There was something covered with
canvas in the back of it, and I knew instinctively
that it was a dead horse. Did I hesitate a second?
Not I. For the sake of my Captain and my country
I would have endured anything. I hailed the
driver. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a dollar if you&rsquo;ll take me to
the station,&rdquo; I panted.</p>
<p>The driver laughed out loud. &ldquo;This is <i>some</i> depoe
hack,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but if <i>you</i> can stand it I guess <i>I</i>
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he gave me a sidewise glance that was
meant to be admiring, I suppose, but I froze him
with a look and climbed gravely up beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very important that I be there in time for
the five o&rsquo;clock train,&rdquo; I remarked by way of explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t running away from school, are you?&rdquo;
inquired the driver genially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am <i>not</i>,&rdquo; I replied frigidly, and looked loftily
past him for the remainder of the five minutes&rsquo; ride
to the station.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>I flung the man the dollar and was out of the
truck before he had time to say a word, and raced
into the long waiting room of the station. I could
have shouted with relief when I saw on the blackboard
the notice that the five o&rsquo;clock train for Washington
was forty minutes late. I was in time!</p>
<p>But where was Captain Bannister? Nowhere in
sight. I walked up and down the length of the waiting
room several times, growing more nervous every
minute. Suppose that he had discovered that he had
left the bag behind and gone back after it only to
find it gone? The thought made my blood run cold.
Would he come down to the train at all without the
bag? Would he not go back and search for it,
alarming the whole college? And all the while I had
it safe with me! What should I do? Should I go
back and run the risk of missing him, or stay and
see if he came? One thing I could do. I could
telephone back to the college and find out if he had
returned for it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>I had just gotten inside the telephone booth and
was ringing up the number when there was a commotion
in the upper end of the waiting room and a
large party of people entered, men and women and
soldiers and young girls, laughing and shrieking and
pelting somebody with rice and old shoes. Soon
they came past the booth and I caught a glimpse of
the bride and groom. The telephone receiver fell
out of my hand and my heart stopped beating. For
there, in the midst of that crowd, laughing and
dodging the showers of rice, and hanging for dear
life to the arm of a pretty young girl in a traveling
suit, was Captain Bannister, my Captain! I shrank
back into the depths of the telephone booth and
struggled to swallow the lump in my throat. Bits of
talk floated in through the closed door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought you&rsquo;d do it up quietly this morning and
then sneak out this afternoon without anybody finding
it out,&rdquo; I heard a voice shout, as a fresh shower
of rice flew through the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went out and made a speech this afternoon, too,
just as unconcerned as if it wasn&rsquo;t his wedding day,&rdquo;
said another voice. &ldquo;Pretty sly, Captain. They
ought to put you in the diplomatic service. You&rsquo;d
be an ornament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I crouched miserably in the telephone booth, trying
to collect my scattered thoughts. My Captain
was married this morning! How I hated that pretty
girl clinging to him and laughing as the showers of
rice fell around her!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Then all of a sudden my hand touched the bag
on the floor. The papers! In the excitement of his
wedding day he had forgotten them! Well, even if
he had, I hadn&rsquo;t. I would still serve my country if
it did nearly kill me to go out there and face Captain
Bannister. I shut my eyes and prayed for
strength. It would have been so easy to slip out
and throw the bag over the bridge into the river,
and get Captain Bannister into a bad predicament.
But I did not waver in my duty. Opening the door
of the booth softly, I crept out. Resolutely I approached
the crowd and walked right up to Captain
Bannister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are the papers, Captain Bannister,&rdquo; I said
in a voice I tried to make coldly sarcastic, as is
fitting when talking to a man who has let his wedding
make him forget his country&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>Captain Bannister whirled around and faced me
with a look of astonishment that changed to annoyance
when he saw the bag. He did not offer to
take it from my outstretched hand. He could not
look into my eyes. He stood there, his face getting
redder every minute, while the people stared curiously.
At last he pulled himself together and took
the bag. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said in a flat voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>A dozen hands pulled the bag away from him.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see the papers, Banny,&rdquo; called several voices.
&ldquo;Are they the plans of your wedding journey or
your new home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a desperate effort to regain possession
of the bag, but they kept it away from him and
opened it. Then such a roar of laughter went up
as I have never heard. Everybody was laughing
but the bride, and she looked like a thundercloud.
Soon the things from the bag were being handed
around and I saw what they were. They were a
girl&rsquo;s ballet dress, very flimsy and very short and
very much bespangled; a pair of light blue silk stockings
and a pair of high-heeled dancing slippers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>Standing on the edge of the crowd I heard one
man explain to another, between snorts of laughter,
how Captain Bannister had taken part in a show that
the soldiers had given a week before and had worn
that ballet dress. His bride-to-be had been at the
show, and being a very straight-laced sort of a person
had been very much shocked at the men dressed
as girls. She didn&rsquo;t know that Captain Bannister
had been one of them, and he didn&rsquo;t intend that she
should find out. Some of his friends knew this and
for a joke they got hold of the handbag in which he
had packed his clothes for his wedding journey and
hid them away, putting in the ballet dress instead.
He found it out on the way out to the college, and
conceived the brilliant idea of leaving it there. He
figured that a suit like that found in a girls&rsquo; college
would cause no commotion; nothing like what would
happen if his bride should find it among his things.
But of all things&mdash;here the man who was telling
all this nearly turned inside out&mdash;somebody sees him
leave the bag behind and chases after him with it!</p>
<p>I fled without ever looking behind. My heart
was broken, my life wrecked, my hopes shattered.
My Captain, my Man, whose eyes had told me the
secret of his love, was pledged to another! If I
hadn&rsquo;t known it beyond any doubt, I wouldn&rsquo;t have
believed such perfidy possible. And the &ldquo;valuable
papers&rdquo; he was carrying around were nothing but
a girl&rsquo;s dancing dress! For this I had raced to catch
the train, for this I had ridden on a truck with a
dead horse! No doubt he had lied to Dr. Thorn
about the bag, because he was afraid he would find
out what really was in it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>Righteous anger drowned my heartbroken tears.
With head high I wandered down to the swimming
pool in the gym and prepared to go in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Hinpoha, come and watch me do the new
back dive,&rdquo; called Agony. She mounted the diving
platform and went off badly, striking the water with
the flat of her back and making a splash like a house
falling into the water. She righted herself and
swam around lazily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hinpoha,&rdquo; she said suddenly, popping her head
out of the water like a devil fish, &ldquo;what did you ever
do with them all? I expected to get at least one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I do with what?&rdquo; I asked in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chocolates, sweet cherub,&rdquo; said Agony, kicking
the water into foam with her feet. &ldquo;I sent you five
pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> sent them?&rdquo; I echoed blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dearest child, I sent them, and it took the
last of my birthday check. Who did you think sent
them?&rdquo; And with a malicious grin she sank down
under the surface of the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>So it had been Agony who had sent the chocolates,
and not Captain Bannister! I might have
known&mdash;&mdash; Oh, what a fool I had been!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do with them all?&rdquo; came Agony&rsquo;s
teasing voice from the other end of the pool, where
she had risen to take the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to know?&rdquo; I said mysteriously.</p>
<p>Agony looked at me gravely for a minute.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I hear Gladys putting you to bed that night
and going off for hot water?&rdquo; she murmured dreamily.
&ldquo;Seems to me I have a faint, far off recollection.&rdquo;
She made little snorting noises, plainly in
imitation of a pig, and sank below the surface again.</p>
<p>I was filled with a blind fury at Agony. I wanted
to jump on her and choke her. I had been standing
on the diving board and on the spur of the moment
I went off backwards. I had only one thought in my
mind; to reach Agony and duck her as she deserved.
There was a great shout as I went off, followed by
a round of applause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked, coming up and blinking
stupidly at the knot of watchers gathered around
the pool.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Hawaiian dive!&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;You did it
perfectly. Do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agony came up out of the pool and watched enviously.
For four weeks she had been practising
that dive and hadn&rsquo;t mastered it yet. I hadn&rsquo;t ever
hoped to learn it. And here I had done it the very
first time! They made me do it again and again,
and clapped until the ceiling echoed as I got the
somersault in every time. It was glorious. I forgave
Agony for fooling me about the Captain; I
even forgave the Captain for the time being. <i>He</i>
could go off and get married if he wanted to; <i>I</i>
could do the Hawaiian back dive!</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you ever do it?&rdquo; asked Agony enviously,
as we dressed together, &ldquo;somersault and all?
Do you really think there&rsquo;s any chance of my ever
doing it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, you&rsquo;ll do it some day,&rdquo; I replied out of
the fullness of my wisdom,&mdash;&ldquo;if you get mad
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>KATHERINE TO THE WINNEBAGOS</h3>
<p><span class="date">Dec. 28, 19&mdash;.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Dearest and Best of Winnies:</span></p>
<p>Oh, you angels without wings, how am I ever going
to thank you? How on earth did you manage
to do it all? Such a Christmas present!</p>
<p>When I saw that array of boxes in the express
office at Spencer all addressed to me I said to the
agent, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some mistake. Those can&rsquo;t possibly
be all mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only Katherine Adams in these parts,
aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said the agent, eyeing that imposing
pile with unconcealed curiosity.</p>
<p>I admitted that I was, as far as I knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;re yours,&rdquo; said the agent, and mine
they proved to be.</p>
<p>Altogether there was a wagonload.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth?&rdquo; said father and Justice when
I drove up to the house. &ldquo;Have you gone into the
trucking business?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas presents, Father!&rdquo; I shouted. &ldquo;All
Christmas presents. I&rsquo;ve got the whole of Santa
Claus&rsquo;s load. Quick, bring me a hammer and an ax
and a jimmy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, girls, when I saw what was in those first
three boxes I just sat down on the floor and wept for
joy. Only the Winnebagos could have thought of
sending me the House of the Open Door. There
were the Indian beds and Hinpoha&rsquo;s bearskin and
all the Navajo blankets and the pottery, just as I
had seen it last in the Open Door Lodge, big as life
and twice as natural. And the note from Sahwah
that came along with them was a piece of Sahwah
herself.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;The things are lonesome,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;and
pining for someone to love them and use them.
I am sending them to your new Camp Fire because
I know your girls will love them as they
deserve to be loved. The ghosts of all the good
times we had in the House of the Open Door
are hovering around the things, so anyone that
gets them can&rsquo;t help falling under the old spell
and learning how to squeeze the most fun out
of every minute.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;The gymnasium apparatus is the Sandwiches&rsquo;
Christmas present. It was Slim&rsquo;s and
the Captain&rsquo;s idea to send it out to you for your
girls and boys to use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;The House of the Open Door is being
turned into Red Cross work rooms for Camp
Fire Girls and we need every inch of space for
the work tables. Even our beloved Lodge is
Giving Service.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gladys Evans, your father is an <i>angel</i>! He
doesn&rsquo;t need to wait until he gets to heaven for his
halo, it&rsquo;s visible a mile off, this minute! To think of
sending me a graphophone and a hundred records!
I simply can&rsquo;t tell you what that is going to mean
to my school. I won&rsquo;t be able to <i>drive</i> the boys and
girls away now!</p>
<p>And your mother! That lantern machine and the
slides showing the Red Cross work and all the other
splendid things is worth its weight in gold.</p>
<p>Oh, my dears! <i>Where</i> did you ever find time to
make those twelve ceremonial dresses?</p>

<p>&ldquo;FROM THE LAST OF THE WINNEBAGOS

<p>I&rsquo;ll bet anything your friend Agony wrote that.
I have a feeling that she and I are kindred spirits.</p>
<p>Won&rsquo;t my girls revel in those beads and looms,
though?</p>
<p>BOOKS! Four whole cases of them! What on

<blockquote>
<p class="center">&ldquo;THE WINNEBAGO LIBRARY

<p>How did you do it? Asked a hundred girls to
give one book apiece? You don&rsquo;t mean to say that
there are a hundred girls interested in us poor backwoods
folks out here in Spencer? I can&rsquo;t believe it!
Oh, we&rsquo;ll work and work and <i>work</i>, to prove ourselves
worthy of it all!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>And oh, all those little personal pretties just for
me! Hinpoha, <i>where</i> did you find that darling pen-holder
with the parrot&rsquo;s head on the end, and
Gladys, who told you that I broke my handglass
and was pining for a white ivory one?</p>
<p>And even a lump of sugar for Sandhelo and a
bow for Piggy&rsquo;s tail! I admire the artist who drew
that bow.</p>
<p>The last box bore Nyoda&rsquo;s return address. What
do you suppose was in it? Her chafing dish! The
very one she used to have in her room, that I used
to admire so much. Dear Nyoda! She knew I
would rather have that than anything else.</p>
<p>O my dears, there never <i>was</i> such a Christmas!
There never <i>will</i> be such a Christmas! Nobody ever
had such friends before. If I live to be a thousand
years old I&rsquo;ll never be able to return one-tenth of

<h3>GLADYS TO KATHERINE</h3>
<p><span class="date">March 25, 19&mdash;.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Dearest Katherine:</span></p>
<p>Listen, my beloved, while I sing you a song of
Migwan. She has awakened at last to find herself
famous, and the rest of us, by reason of reflected
glory, found ourselves looked upon as different from
all other animals, and wonderfully popular and run
after by five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, like Old Man
Kangaroo. And, all precepts upon precepts to the
contrary, it wasn&rsquo;t conscientiously applying herself
to her task that turned the trick, but deliberate shirking.
After all, though, it was mostly a matter of
chance, because if it hadn&rsquo;t rained so that night last
October, Migwan would have gone to the library as
she should have, and the world would have lost a
priceless contribution to Indian lore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>It happened thusly. One of Migwan&rsquo;s cronies in
the sophomore class has a weak throat and a condition
in Indian History. On the night I have mentioned
she trickled tearfully into Migwan&rsquo;s room
and confided that she simply had to have an Indian
legend to read in class the following day or be
marked zero. She had had all the week in which to
look one up in the library, but, according to immemorial
custom, she had left it for the last night.
Now it was raining pitchforks and she didn&rsquo;t dare
go out, because she got a terrible attack of quinsy
every time there was an east wind. Migwan, like
the angel she is, promptly offered to go over and
hunt one up for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of an Indian legend?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, any kind,&rdquo; replied Harriet carelessly, &ldquo;so
long as it&rsquo;s <i>Indian</i>. We&rsquo;re studying the Soul of the
Savage as revealed by legend, or something like that.
Slip it under my door when you come back with it.
I&rsquo;m going to bed and coddle my throat. Be sure you
don&rsquo;t get one that&rsquo;s too long,&rdquo; she called back over
her shoulder, &ldquo;remember there are twenty in the
class to help reveal the Savage Soul.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Harriet ambled placidly back to her room and
Migwan began hunting through her closet for her
raincoat and rubbers. She didn&rsquo;t find them, because
she had lent them to somebody the week before and
couldn&rsquo;t remember whom she lent them to. She
looked out of the window at the torrents coming
down and decided that her little rocking chair by the
lamp held out more attraction than a trip to the
library. But she didn&rsquo;t have the heart to disappoint
Harriet by not getting her an Indian legend to read
in class the next day, so she sat down and manufactured
one, which is as easy as rolling off a log
for Migwan. Harriet would never know the difference,
and neither would the teacher, off hand,
and a made-up legend would save the day for Harriet
as well as a genuine one. The chances were
she wouldn&rsquo;t be called upon to read it anyway. You
never are, you know, when you&rsquo;ve broken your neck
to be ready. Migwan slipped it under Harriet&rsquo;s
door and then forgot all about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>Several weeks later, when the <i>Monthly Morterboard</i>
came out, there was Migwan&rsquo;s Indian legend,
big as life. It had obviously been used to fill up
space and was not credited to the literary talent of
the college; but to Joseph Latoka, or &ldquo;Standing
Pine,&rdquo; the Penobscot Indian who had collected the
legends of his tribe into a book, which was in the
college library and which was our authority on
things Indian. Migwan laughed to herself over it,
but never gave away the fact that she had written it.
She discovered in a roundabout way that the Literary
Editor of the <i>Morterboard</i> had been in despair
over lack of material when the October number was
due, and told her tale of woe to Miss Percival, one
of the teachers, and asked her if she had any essays
fit to print. Miss Percival replied that she hadn&rsquo;t
had a decent essay this semester, but a girl in one
of her classes had brought in a rather remarkable
Indian legend several days before, which might serve
to cast into the breach. The <i>Morterboard</i> editor
promptly hunted up Harriet and demanded the legend.
Harriet still had it among her goods and chattels,
and gave it to her readily, saying that it was
one of Joseph Latoka&rsquo;s <i>Legends of the Penobscot
Indians</i>, which she honestly believed to be the fact.
The <i>Morterboard</i> editor took her word for it and
used the legend to fill up the chinks in the October
issue.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">*    *    *    *    *    *</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>It was not long after this that Very Seldom paid
his annual visit to Brownell. His name really wasn&rsquo;t
Very Seldom; it was Jeremiah Selden, but everybody
referred to him as Jerry, and it wasn&rsquo;t long
before &ldquo;Jerry Selden&rdquo; became &ldquo;Very Seldom.&rdquo; He
used to be Professor of Sociology at Brownell, but
he had to give up lecturing because he lost his voice.
He was a sad little man with a plaintive droop to his
white mustache and only a whisper of a voice. He
had lost his whole family in some kind of a railroad
accident and always went around with such a
homeless air that everybody felt sorry for him. His
hobby was Indian History, Indian Legends and Indian
Relics. After he gave up teaching sociology
he took to writing books, dry old essays and that
sort of thing. Nobody ever read them, and he didn&rsquo;t
make much out of them, but he kept plodding along,
always hoping that he would make a hit the next
time.</p>
<p>Once every year he came back to Brownell to
spend Sunday, to keep alive the memories of his
former life, he used to explain sentimentally. Miss
Allison, his successor as professor of sociology, and
who has him beat forty miles for teaching, always
entertained him at tea on the occasion of his visit,
and used to ask him stacks of questions, jollying
him along and making him believe she was in doubt
about a lot of things she knew better than he did.
Having his opinion consulted that way made him
feel quite cheerful and important, and his visit to
Brownell always put new life into him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>It happened that one Sunday afternoon Migwan
went to Miss Allison&rsquo;s room to ask her about something
and ran into Very Seldom paying his annual
visit. Miss Allison herself wasn&rsquo;t there. She had
been called out of town the night before and had
turned over the job of entertaining Very Seldom to
her room-mate, Miss Lee. Miss Lee taught mathematics
and didn&rsquo;t care a rap about sociology, and
still less about Indians. Miss Lee is very fond of
Migwan, and invited her to stay to tea. Migwan is
forever getting asked to tea by the faculty; it&rsquo;s because
she always gets her hair parted so straight in
the middle, and never upsets her teacup.</p>
<p>Migwan had heard about Very Seldom, and was
just as anxious to help cheer him up as anybody, but
this time he didn&rsquo;t need any cheering. He was positively
radiant. He was talking about his latest book
and was nearly bursting with enthusiasm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>It seems that all his life he had been having an
argument with another Indian History shark as to
whether, before the coming of the white man to this
continent, the eastern Indians had ever lived on, or
visited the western plains. He maintained that they
had, while his friend insisted that they hadn&rsquo;t. Just
recently he had read, in a magazine published by the
Indian Society of North America, a hitherto unpublished
legend of Joseph Latoka&rsquo;s, a curious legend
of the White Buffalo. To his mind this proved
beyond a doubt that the Penobscot Indians had, at
some time or other, lived on or visited the Great
Plains, and had seen the Buffalo. It was the only
Penobscot legend that mentioned the buffalo as an
object of worship. He had immediately written
a monograph on the subject which was even then in
the hands of the publisher. It was a great point to
have discovered. Fame would come to him at last.
Very Seldom&rsquo;s air of desolation had vanished; his
hour of triumph had come.</p>
<p>It was at this point that Migwan, the expert tea
drinker, suddenly upset her cup all over Miss Allison&rsquo;s
cherished Mexican drawnwork lunchcloth.
That foolish legend that she had manufactured to
save herself a trip to the library in the rain had been
taken as authentic and had been copied from the
<i>Morterboard</i> into other magazines! At the time
she wrote it she was in too much of a hurry to pay
attention to any such trifles as the difference between
Eastern and Plains Indians. Anyway, she hadn&rsquo;t
<i>said</i> anywhere that they were Penobscot Indians, it
was Harriet who had said so to the <i>Morterboard</i>
editor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>Several times during the evening she tried to tell
poor Very Seldom that the Legend of the White
Buffalo, which proved his point so conclusively, was
not a legend at all, but her own composition,
but each time the words choked her. The little
ex-Professor&rsquo;s satisfaction was so great and his happiness
so supreme that she didn&rsquo;t have the heart to
blot it out. The secret was hers. Everybody in college
believed that legend to have come from the collection
of Joseph Latoka. All the evening she debated
with herself whether or not she should tell, or
let the fake legend go down on record. In the end
the professor&rsquo;s happiness won the day and she decided
not to mar his almost childish glee in his discovery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What does it matter, after all?&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;About three-fourths of the things that are written
about Indians aren&rsquo;t true. Nobody will read his old
monograph anyway, so no harm will be done. If it
gives him so much pleasure to think he&rsquo;s discovered
something, why spoil it all?&rdquo; The whole matter
seemed so trivial to Migwan that it wasn&rsquo;t worth
fussing about. Just what difference did it make to
the world, especially at this time, whether the eastern
Indians of the United States had ever visited the
western plains or not? It seemed about as important
as whether the Fourth Emperor of the Ming
Dynasty had carrots for dinner or parsnips. So she
went home without revealing the origin of the Legend
of the White Buffalo.</p>
<p>She thought the incident was decently interred,
and had forgotten all about it, when&mdash;pop! out came
Jack-in-the-box once more. Along in March came
the celebrated lecturer on Indian costumes, Dr. Burnett.
Handbills announcing his lecture were distributed
all over town a week before his coming. The
public was to be admitted and half the proceeds were
to go to the library fund. Migwan picked up one
of the handbills and glanced casually at the subject
of the lecture. Then her hair nearly turned green.
It was &ldquo;The Legend of the White Buffalo,&rdquo; based
on the book of the late Professor Jeremiah Selden!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>The first fact that struck Migwan was that Very
Seldom was dead, which came as a shock of surprise.
Poor Very Seldom! He had found a home
at last. But before he went he had had his inning
and had died happy that he had contributed an important
link to the chains of Indian History.</p>
<p>Then Migwan realized what a horrible mess she
had started by writing that legend and keeping still
about it. If anybody ever found out about it now,
Dr. Burnett&rsquo;s reputation would be ruined.</p>
<p>An hour before the lecture was to begin found
Migwan sitting in the parlor of the hotel waiting
for Dr. Burnett to come down in answer to the note
she sent up with a bellboy. He came presently, a
long-haired, Van Dyke-y sort of man, who smiled
genially at her and inquired affably what he could
do for the charming miss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; said Migwan breathlessly, &ldquo;could
you give some other lecture just as well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could I give some other lecture just as well?&rdquo;
repeated Dr. Burnett in perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Migwan went on desperately, trying to get
it over with quickly, &ldquo;could you? You see, the
Legend of the White Buffalo isn&rsquo;t a legend at all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Legend of the White Buffalo <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> a legend!&rdquo;
repeated Dr. Burnett again, looking at Migwan
as if he thought she was not in her right mind.
&ldquo;Pray, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s a fake,&rdquo; said Migwan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fake!&rdquo; exclaimed Dr. Burnett, in astonishment.
&ldquo;And how do you know it is a fake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I wrote it myself,&rdquo; said Migwan, trying
to break the news as gently as possible, &ldquo;because
it was simply pouring, and Harriet had a sore
throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wrote it yourself because it was simply
pouring and Harriet had a sore throat?&rdquo; repeated
Dr. Burnett, now acting as if he were sure she was
out of her mind.</p>
<p>Then Migwan explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear,&rdquo; said Dr. Burnett, &ldquo;you <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>
have written that legend. No white man could have
invented it. It is the very breath and spirit of the
Indian. In it the Soul of the Savage stands revealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I <i>did</i>,&rdquo; insisted Migwan, and finally succeeded
in convincing him that she was telling the
truth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Dr. Burnett usually spent from one to three
months preparing a new lecture. He prepared one
that night in an hour that knocked the shine out of
all his previous ones. His speech entitled, &ldquo;What
Chance Has a Man When a Woman Takes a Hand&rdquo;
brought down the house. He told the story of the
fake legend, and the audience was alternately laughing
at the neat way Migwan had taken everybody
in and weeping at the way she wouldn&rsquo;t spoil poor
Very Seldom&rsquo;s pleasure.</p>
<p>Migwan was the heroine of the hour. The whole
college sought her acquaintance forthwith. Of
course, they found out all about the Winnebagos,
and how Migwan came to know so much about Indian
lore, and Hinpoha and I, being Winnebagos,
too, came in for our share of the glory. Our humble
apartment is filled to overflowing all day long
with girls who want to make Migwan&rsquo;s acquaintance
and casually drop in on us in the hope of meeting her
in our chamber. It is great to be fellow-Winnebago
with a celebrity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>But I haven&rsquo;t told you all yet. The day after the
lecture Dr. Burnett had a solemn conference with
that portion of the English Department which was
so fortunate to have Migwan in its classes, after
which Migwan was called in. She went with a kind
of scary feeling because she thought Dr. Burnett
might be going to have her arrested for perpetrating
the fake, but instead of that she was informed that
she showed such budding talent in composition and
had such a positive genius for portraying the soul
of the Indian that he wanted her to work with him
in his research work after she graduated from college.
She is to make a grand tour with him among
the real Indians on the reservations and get them to
tell tales of the old days as they remember them
from the legends of their fathers and then she is to
write them down to be published in a book.</p>
<p>Just imagine it! There is Migwan&rsquo;s future all
cut out for her with a cookie cutter, all because she
was too lazy to go across the campus in the rain and
get a real legend for a sick friend. Isn&rsquo;t life queer?</p>
<p><span class="center">Famously yours,</span>

<h3>SAHWAH TO KATHERINE</h3>
<p><span class="date">April 4, 19&mdash;.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Dearest K:</span></p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to think you&rsquo;re the only one having
adventures with your work. Your little old
Sahwah is a sure enough grown up young lady now,
a real wage-earner, making her little track along the
Open Road, and frequently stepping into mud holes
and falling flat on her face. I&rsquo;m &ldquo;Miss Brewster&rdquo;
now, in a tailored suit and plain shirtwaist, ready to
conquer the world with a notebook and typewriter.
I finished my course at the business college early in
February, and one day while I was in the last stages
of completion as a stenographer and nearly ready to
have a shipping tag pasted on me in the shape of a
graduation certificate, I was summoned into the private
office of Mr. Barrett, the head of the school.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>I had a chill when the office girl brought me the
message. There were only two or three things you
were ever sent to Mr. Barrett for. One was failure
to pay your tuition; another was doing so poorly
in your work that you were a disgrace instead of a
credit to the school; another was for &ldquo;skipping
school.&rdquo; A number of the girls were in the habit
of cutting classes after lunch several days in the
week and either going to the matinee or running
around town with boys from the school. Many
complaints about this had come to Mr. Barrett from
the teachers, until he got so that he sent for everyone
who skipped and read them a stiff lecture. He is a
very stern, austere man, and the whole school stands
in dread of him.</p>
<p>I went over my list of sins when I was summoned
to the office. My tuition was paid up until
the end; there was no trouble there. It wouldn&rsquo;t
be my lessons either; for, while I was far from being
the eighth wonder of the world on the typewriter,
I still had managed to stay in the &ldquo;A&rdquo; division
since the first. But&mdash;here my hair began to
stand on end&mdash;I had &ldquo;skipped school&rdquo; the afternoon
before. Slim had come home from college to attend
the funeral of his grandfather, and had called
me up and invited me to go automobiling with him
while he was waiting for his train to go back, and
you can guess what happened to Duty. I just naturally
skipped school and went with him. It was the
first and only time I had skipped in my whole career,
but I was evidently going to get my trimmings for it.
I went into the office with a sinking heart, for up
until this time I had managed to keep in Mr. Barrett&rsquo;s
good graces, and I did pride myself quite a bit
on my unreproved state. But I made up my mind to
take it like a good sport&mdash;I had danced and now
I would pay the piper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>Having gone into the office in such a state of
mind, I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for the shock when Mr.
Barrett looked up from his desk and greeted me with
a (for him) extremely amiable smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Miss Brewster,&rdquo; he said pleasantly,
pulling up a chair for me beside his own.</p>
<p>I sat down. It was time, for my knees were giving
away under me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Brewster,&rdquo; Mr. Barrett began affably, &ldquo;I
have here&rdquo;&mdash;and he picked up a paper on which he
had made some notations&mdash;&ldquo;a call for a stenographer
which is a little out of the ordinary line.&rdquo; He
paused to let that sink in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; I murmured respectfully. My heart
began to beat freely again. He wasn&rsquo;t going to lecture
me about skipping school!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Osgood Harper,&rdquo; continued Mr. Barrett
crisply, &ldquo;telephoned me this morning personally, and
asked if I had a young lady whom I could send her
every day from nine until one to attend to her personal
correspondence. She is very particular about
the kind of person she wants; it must be someone
who is refined and educated, as well as a good stenographer,
for a good deal of her work will be social
correspondence. She also intimated that the girl
must be&mdash;er, reasonably good looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused a second time and again I said meekly,
&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be anything else
to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have carefully considered all the girls in the
finishing class,&rdquo; continued Mr. Barrett, &ldquo;and you
seem to be the only one I could consider for the
position. I know Mrs. Harper and know that in
some ways she will be hard to work for. But the
pay she offers is generous; better than you could do
as a beginner in a commercial house, and the hours
are excellent, nine to one, leaving your afternoons
free. Besides that, there will be the advantage to
yourself of coming in contact with such people as
the Harpers, and the pleasure of working in such
beautiful surroundings. You are a girl who will appreciate
such things. You know who the Harpers
are, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>I had never heard of them, but I was quite willing
to be enlightened. The Harpers, it seemed, were
in the first boatload of settlers that landed on our
town site; they had since accumulated such a fortune
that it made Pike&rsquo;s Peak look like an ant hill;
and no matter what string Mrs. Harper harped on,
people were sure to sit still and listen. Now she
desired a personal stenographer of maidenly form,
and I, Sahwah the Sunfish, had been measured by
the awe-inspiring Mr. Barrett and found fit.</p>
<p>My feelings as I came out of the office were far
different from those with which I went in. I entered
with a guilty droop; I came out with my head
in the air. I hadn&rsquo;t dreamed of getting such a position
to start with. I had pictured myself as beginning
at the bottom in some big office and slowly
working to the top. But to begin my career by doing
the private work of Mrs. Osgood Harper! It
seemed like some fairy tale. I tried to think of
something to say to Mr. Barrett to thank him for
having recommended me for the position, but the
shock had sent my wits skylarking, and the only
thing that came into my head was that song that we
used to sing:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Out of a city of six million people, why did you
pick upon me?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and that, of course, was impossible as a noble sentiment.</p>
<p>The next morning I set out on my Joyous Venture.
The Osgood Harpers lived on the Heights in
a great colonial house set up high on a hill and approached
by long, winding walks. It was more than
a mile from the street-car, but I enjoyed the walk
through those beautiful estates. I couldn&rsquo;t have
served a tennis ball in any direction without hitting
a millionaire.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harper was a stout and tremendously impressive
lady about forty years old. She had steely
blue eyes that looked right through me until I began
to have horrible fears that there was something
wrong with my appearance and she would presently
say that I would not do at all. But she didn&rsquo;t; all
she said was, &ldquo;So you are Miss Brewster, are you?&rdquo;
and motioned me to sit down at a writing table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>She had received me in a cozy little sitting room
which opened out of her bedroom, and it seemed
that this was to be my office. She started right in
to lay out my work for me and I didn&rsquo;t have much
time to look around at the beautiful furnishings.
The work was far different from anything we had
had in school, but very interesting, and I took to it
from the start. Mrs. Harper is chairman of countless
committees, and secretary of several societies,
and there were quantities of notices to send out to
committee members, and letters to write to business
men soliciting subscriptions to various funds and
things like that, all to be written on heavy linen
paper of finest quality, bearing the Harper monogram
in embossed gold in the upper left-hand corner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>I worked away with a will and the morning hours
flew. I would have worked right on past one o&rsquo;clock
without knowing it if there hadn&rsquo;t been an interruption.
Shortly after noon the door opened and
a girl of about seventeen walked in. She was extremely
pretty; that is, at first glance she was. She
was very fair, with bright pink cheeks and big blue
eyes. Her yellow hair was plastered down over her
forehead in an exaggerated style, and monstrous
pearl earrings dangled from her ears. She had evidently
just come in from outdoors, for she wore
an all mink coat and held a mink cap in her hand.
Without a glance in my direction she began chatting
to Mrs. Harper in a thin, nasal, high-pitched
voice. I dropped my eyes and went on with my
work. In a minute I could feel her staring at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethel,&rdquo; said Mrs. Harper, as soon as she could
get the floor, &ldquo;this is Miss Brewster, my stenographer.
Miss Brewster, my daughter Ethel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I acknowledged the introduction pleasantly; Miss
Ethel favored me with another stare, murmured
something in an indistinct tone and then immediately
turned her back on me and went on talking to
her mother. Right then and there my admiration
for the &ldquo;first families&rdquo; got a setback; I didn&rsquo;t admire
Ethel Harper&rsquo;s manners, not a little bit. She
had &ldquo;snob&rdquo; written all over her features. I could
see that she classed me with the servants and as such
she didn&rsquo;t trouble herself to be polite to me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A lot there is to be gained by associating with
<i>her</i>,&rdquo; I said to myself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be just as cool and dignified
as possible when <i>she&rsquo;s</i> around. She won&rsquo;t get
another chance to snub me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in spite of her I was enthusiastic about the
position and could hardly wait until I got there the
next day. Mrs. Harper went out shortly after I
arrived and I worked alone. Ethel Harper came
home from school at noon and went through the
room on the way to her mother&rsquo;s, but I rattled away
on the typewriter and never looked up. She came
out soon and went into her own room, which was
on the other side. In about fifteen minutes I heard
her call me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Brewster!&rdquo; I stopped typing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; she called, and her voice sounded
impatient.</p>
<p>I stepped across the hall into her room. She was
standing in front of the mirror putting on a ruffled
taffeta dress, which she was struggling to adjust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hook me up!&rdquo; she commanded, without the formality
of saying &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>I had it on the end of my tongue to tell her that
I was a stenographer, not a lady&rsquo;s maid, but I remembered
&ldquo;Give Service&rdquo; in time, and hooked her
up without a word. She never even said &ldquo;Thank
you!&rdquo; She just sat down at her dressing table and
began pencilling her eyebrows. Evidently it must
have been the maid&rsquo;s day out, for she called me in
again later to pin her collar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I got too much color on my face?&rdquo; she
asked languidly, dabbing away at her cheeks with
some red stuff out of a box in front of her. Then
she put carmine on her lips, a sort of whitewash on
her nose and forehead and finished it with some
pencilled shadows under her eyes. All I could think
of was Eeny-Meeny, the time we gave her that coat
of war paint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked milady while I was fastening
her collar, poking her finger at my Torch Bearer&rsquo;s
pin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Camp Fire pin,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Camp Fire?&rdquo; she demanded idly.</p>
<p>I explained briefly what Camp Fire was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; said Ethel elegantly, &ldquo;none of that for
mine!&rdquo; And she picked up her eyebrow pencil
again and did a little more frescoing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>I went back to my work in disgust. I was so
disappointed in Ethel Harper. I had expected that
the daughter of such a fine family would be a real
lady in every sense of the word&mdash;cultured, genuine,
thoroughbred; and she had turned out to be nothing
but a cheap imitation&mdash;slangy, ill-bred, snobbish,
overdressed and made up like an actress. Beyond
her pretty, baby doll face there was nothing to her.
There wasn&rsquo;t an ounce of brains in her poor flat
head.</p>
<p>And yet, she was tremendously popular in her own
snobbish set, as I could gather from conversations
around me, and by the invitations she was constantly
receiving to festivities. Although she was not formally
out in society, I knew that she went out to
dances with men very often, when her mother
thought that she was spending the night with girl
friends. I found that out from telephone conversations
Ethel carried on when her mother was out
of the way. It was plain to be seen that Ethel had
only one ambition in the world, and that was to have
a good time, regardless of how she got it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t any of my business, of course, but I
couldn&rsquo;t help wondering what Mrs. Harper would
do if she knew about some of Ethel&rsquo;s little excursions.
Mrs. Harper had a flinty sort of nature and
you only had to look into those cold eyes of hers to
know that it would go hard with anyone who had
displeased her. One morning I had a good chance
to see her when she was roused. A Cloisonn&eacute;
locket belonging to Mrs. Harper had disappeared
from her jewel box and she had accused her maid,
Clarice, of taking it. Clarice, frightened out of her
wits, was tearfully protesting her innocence, but
Mrs. Harper towered over her like a fury, threatening
to hand her over to the police. Ethel, sitting in
a rocking chair polishing her finger nails, listened
indifferently. I felt embarrassed to witness this
painful scene and stood irresolute, unable to decide
whether to go out or stay, when Mrs. Harper turned
to me and said, &ldquo;Make out a check for Clarice&rsquo;s
wages for the month and deduct twenty-five dollars
from it, the value of the locket she stole. Then insert
an advertisement in the papers for a new maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clarice, with a fresh burst of grief, declared again
that she knew nothing about the locket, and begged
not to be sent away with a black character, because
she had a paralyzed sister to support, but Mrs. Harper
was unmoved. Out went Clarice, bag and baggage,
crying as she went and still declaring her innocence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;These maids will steal you blind, if you give
them a chance,&rdquo; said Mrs. Harper, still bristling
with anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did like Clarice,&rdquo; remarked Ethel with
a yawn.</p>
<p>The next day Mrs. Harper went out during the
morning and Ethel called me to help her pack her
visiting bag. She was going to spend the week-end
with a girl friend. No new maid had come to take
Clarice&rsquo;s place as yet, so Ethel took advantage of
my not having much work to do for her mother
that morning to press me into service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find my wrist watch,&rdquo; she said as I
came in. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I put it in the bag
or not, and I haven&rsquo;t time to look. Will you look
through the bag while I finish dressing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pawed carefully through the bag, and brought
to light, not the wrist watch, but the Cloisonn&eacute;
locket, which Mrs. Harper had accused Clarice of
taking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Ethel,&rdquo; I said delightedly, &ldquo;here is your
mother&rsquo;s locket! Clarice didn&rsquo;t steal it after all.
It was down in your bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it was,&rdquo; said Ethel coolly. &ldquo;I put it
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> put it there?&rdquo; I echoed. &ldquo;Did you find it,
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel laughed disagreeably. &ldquo;I had it all the
while,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to a dance to-night
that mamma doesn&rsquo;t know anything about, and
I&rsquo;ve set my heart on wearing that locket. Mamma
will never let me wear it; it was brought to her
from Paris by an old friend that&rsquo;s dead now, and
she&rsquo;s afraid I&rsquo;ll lose it. So I just took it out of
her jewel box the other day and made her believe
Clarice took it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethel!&rdquo; I exclaimed in horror. &ldquo;How could
you? How could you sit there and hear your mother
accuse poor Clarice of taking it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;I never did like
Clarice,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She was an impertinent piece.
It served her right. Put the locket back in the bag.
I&rsquo;ve got to start in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t budge. I stood looking at her until
she looked the other way. With all her millions
and all her fine connections, I despised Ethel Harper
as if she had been a crawling worm. I didn&rsquo;t want
to get mixed up in anything that wasn&rsquo;t my business,
but I had no intention of letting poor Clarice
remain under a cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to put it back in the bag,&rdquo; I replied
firmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take it right back to
your mother when she comes home. She must
know that it isn&rsquo;t stolen so she can make things
right with Clarice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare tell mamma,&rdquo; said Ethel furiously.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll kill me if she knows I&rsquo;ve got it.
Give it to me, I say.&rdquo; She tried to snatch it out
of my hand, but I kept hold of it. &ldquo;Give it to me,
you impertinent little stenographer, you!&rdquo; she
shrieked.</p>
<p>It was getting disgraceful. I tried to save a
shred of dignity. I laid the locket on the dresser
and faced Ethel steadily. I still had a vivid memory
of Clarice&rsquo;s distressed face as she went out
that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have done Clarice a wrong,&rdquo; I said firmly,
&ldquo;and it must be righted. I&rsquo;ll give you your choice.
Either you take the locket back to your mother or
I&rsquo;ll tell her where it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>Ethel changed her tactics and tried to bribe me.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a dozen pairs of silk stockings if you
don&rsquo;t say anything to mamma about it and let her
go on thinking it&rsquo;s stolen, so I can wear it whenever
I please,&rdquo; she offered.</p>
<p>I longed to choke her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you try to bribe
me, Ethel Harper,&rdquo; I said severely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a
code of honor, even if I am a poor stenographer,
which is more than you have, with all your millions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some more of your Campfire stuff,&rdquo; she said
sneeringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet it is &lsquo;Campfire stuff,&rsquo;&rdquo; I replied hotly.
&ldquo;You see that little pin? One of things it says is
&lsquo;Be trustworthy.&rsquo; If I let Clarice be unjustly accused
I wouldn&rsquo;t be worthy of that pin. Remember!
Either you tell your mother or I do.&rdquo; And I
started for the door.</p>
<p>Ethel changed her tune again and began to cry.
&ldquo;Everybody is so horrid to me,&rdquo; she sobbed.
&ldquo;Mamma will never let me go anywhere I want to
go or wear what I want to wear, and the servants
won&rsquo;t do what I tell them. Even my mother&rsquo;s
stenographer bosses me around! I wish I was
dead!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>But I was firm in my championship of Clarice.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to tell,&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;I see your
mother coming in now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel began to look frightened. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not tell her
I took it, she&rsquo;d kill me,&rdquo; she whined. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her I
just found it and she can take back what she said to
Clarice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked her steadily in the eyes. She flushed
and looked down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll go and tell anyway, you old
tattletale,&rdquo; she said savagely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get even with
you for this, see if I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; She ran out of the
room and I didn&rsquo;t see her again for several days.</p>
<p>However, I knew the locket had gone back where
it belonged, because Mrs. Harper had me send
Clarice a check for twenty-five dollars, with the
brief statement that the locket had been found.
Right there was where I lost some of my regard
for Mrs. Harper. She never apologized to Clarice
for accusing her wrongfully; never offered to do
anything to make it up to her. She just sent that
cold little note and the check. A real thoroughbred
would have acknowledged herself to be in the
wrong, but Mrs. Harper couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to
apologize to a servant. The affair blew over and
I never heard Clarice mentioned again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>I grew to like my work more and more, as the
days went by, and gradually learned to handle quite
a bit of it myself. Mrs. Harper was very busy;
she did a great deal of Red Cross and other war
work, besides keeping up in all her clubs, and she
got into the habit of telling me what to say to
people and letting me write the letters myself.
Early in March she went out of town to a convention
and left me with a great many letters to write
to various people, telling me to sign her name for
her. I took very great pains with all those letters
so as to be sure to say the right things to the right
people, and I felt satisfied when the week was out
that I had done myself credit.</p>
<p>Accordingly, it struck me like a thunderbolt when,
several days after her return, Mrs. Harper came to
me, blazing with anger, and demanded to know
what I meant by writing such letters in her absence.
Startled, I asked her what she referred to.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wrote Mr. Samuel Butler that if he didn&rsquo;t
hurry and pay up his subscription to the Red Cross
Mr. Harper would pay it for him and take it out
of his next bill,&rdquo; said Mrs. Harper furiously. &ldquo;Mr.
Butler is insulted and has withdrawn his subscription
of ten thousand dollars to the Perkins Settlement
House, which I am trying so hard to establish.
Whatever possessed you to write such a letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never wrote a letter like that,&rdquo; I replied with
spirit. &ldquo;I wrote Mr. Butler a very polite, respectful
reminder that his pledge was due this month; I
never mentioned Mr. Harper or anything about paying
it and taking the amount out of any bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was completely at sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>did</i> write that letter!&rdquo; declared Mrs. Harper
angrily. &ldquo;How dare you deny it? Mr. Butler
showed it to me. It was written on this very stationery,
on this typewriter with the green ribbon,
and signed with my name in the way you sign it.
You wrote it to be funny, I suppose. Well, I can
tell you that I can&rsquo;t have anything like that. I won&rsquo;t
have any further need for your services.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>She was so positive I had written it that I began
to have an awful feeling that I might have written
it in my sleep. You know what strange things I
do in my sleep sometimes. But all the while I knew
who had done it. Ethel Harper had sworn to get
even with me for making her tell her mother about
the locket. She had written that letter in place of
the one I had written. I remembered that one day
while Mrs. Harper was away I had been called
downstairs and kept talking for over an hour to one
of Mrs. Harper&rsquo;s committee members who had undertaken
to distribute some literature and came for
instructions. During that time Ethel would have
had plenty of chance to read through my mail upstairs.</p>
<p>I started to tell Mrs. Harper that I suspected
someone else of writing it, intending to lead gently
up to the subject of Ethel, but Mrs. Harper scoffed
at the idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t anyone else in the house who can run
the typewriter,&rdquo; she said flatly.</p>
<p>This was untrue. Ethel could run it; she had
done so several times when I was there. But what
was the use of accusing Ethel when her mother
wouldn&rsquo;t believe it anyway? I realized the hopelessness
of trying to convince Mrs. Harper of something
she didn&rsquo;t want to believe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And further,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Harper, &ldquo;I have
found that you have not been attending strictly to
business. Ethel tells me that you often go over to
her room when she is there and stand and talk to
her instead of giving your time to my work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little snake-in-the-grass!&rdquo; I thought vengefully.
I had never gone to her room unless she had called
me to do something.</p>
<p>I made up my mind I wouldn&rsquo;t stay there another
minute. I didn&rsquo;t have to work for such people.
I drew myself up stiffly. &ldquo;If you believe such
things, Mrs. Harper,&rdquo; I said icily, &ldquo;there can be no
business relations between us. I shall not even take
the trouble to prove the truth about that letter. I
shall go immediately.&rdquo; And go I did. I knew Mr.
Barrett would be very much put out over the affair,
because he seemed to think Mrs. Harper had done
his school an honor by hiring one of his pupils, but
what was I to do? Stay there and be the scapegoat
for all Ethel&rsquo;s sins. Not while I had feet to
walk away on.</p>
<p>As I went down the steps I met Ethel coming
up. She looked at me with a meaning expression
and a triumphant smile. She had kept her word and
gotten even with me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>I felt badly over it, of course, for who can lose
a good position and not be cut up about it? I suppose
I must have looked pretty doleful for a couple
of days, because I met Mrs. Anderson, that friend
of Nyoda&rsquo;s, who used to lend us so many &ldquo;props&rdquo;
for our Winnebago performances, on the street and
she asked me right away what was the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lonesome for those friends of yours,&rdquo;
she went on, without giving me a chance to answer.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m lonesome, too,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;My husband
has been in Washington all winter. Come out and
spend a few days with me. You used to be pretty
good company, if I remember rightly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She persuaded me and I went. You remember
the Anderson place out on the East Shore, don&rsquo;t
you? We were all out there once last year. Perfect
duck of a house all made of soft gray shingles
and seven acres of garden and woods around it. I
tramped all over the place through the March mud,
looking for signs of spring, and had a perfectly
glorious time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one sign of spring, over there,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Anderson, who was with me on one of my
tramps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; I asked, looking around.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Young man&rsquo;s fancy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Anderson with
a laugh of tolerant amusement, &ldquo;lightly turning to
thoughts of love. Look up on the barn there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked where she pointed, and saw a boy of
about eighteen standing on the roof of the barn
gazing off into space through a field glass. He
had a white flag tied to his right wrist, which he
was waving over his head, like the soldiers do when
they signal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he and what is he doing?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Peter, the boy who helps around the
stable,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Anderson. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sending messages
to his lady love. A certain combination of
flourishes means &lsquo;I love you,&rsquo; and another means
&lsquo;Meet me to-night,&rsquo; and so on. He told John, my
chauffeur, about it, and John told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How silly!&rdquo; said I, with a laugh for poor lovesick
Peter. &ldquo;Who is the object of his affection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some servant girl from the next estate,&rdquo; replied
Mrs. Anderson. &ldquo;They carry on their affair
through field glasses and with signals. They think
they are having a thrilling romance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disgusting!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;How could any girl make
such a fool of herself where everybody can see
her!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>Mrs. Anderson laughed indulgently, but I could
feel her scorn underneath it. &ldquo;Some girls will sell
every scrap of dignity they have for what they consider
a good time, my dear,&rdquo; she said, laying her
hand on my arm in a motherly way.</p>
<p>We left Romeo on the barn flourishing out his
messages in the late March sunshine and wandered
over to the next estate. There was a new litter of
prize bull pups over there and Mrs. Anderson had
promised that I should see them before I went home.
A creek divided the two estates, which we crossed
on a little foot bridge. The path led along beside
the creek for a while until the little stream widened
out into a beautiful pond, big enough for boating.
A pier had been built at one side of the pond, running
out into the water. Someone was standing
out on the end of the pier, and as we came up we
saw that we had discovered the other half of the
romance. A girl, with a field glass held to her
eyes and a white flag tied around her right wrist,
was signalling in the direction of the Anderson
barn, the roof of which was visible in the distance,
beyond Mrs. Anderson&rsquo;s apple orchard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Something about the girl was familiar, even in the
distance, and as we came near I recognized the mink
coat that I had seen many times lately. There was
no doubt about it. The girl on the end of the pier
was Ethel Harper. I stood still, too much disgusted
to speak. Ethel Harper, the daughter of one of the
&ldquo;first&rdquo; families, with the best social position in the
city, her mother prominent in all great uplift movements,
carrying on a vulgar flirtation with Mrs.
Anderson&rsquo;s stable boy! So this was the great romance
she had been hinting about at various times!
Randall&mdash;that was the name of the girl she was
intimate with; this was the Randall place. She had
been coming here so often for the sake of the boy
next door. Did she know he was an ignorant servant?
I doubted it. Anything in men&rsquo;s clothes set
her silly head awhirl. I wished her haughty mother
could have seen her then.</p>
<p>Mrs. Anderson suddenly laughed out loud and
at that Ethel turned around and saw us. She gave
a great start as she recognized me, took a step backward
and fell off the end of the pier into the pond,
disappearing with a shriek into the deep water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>I slipped out of my coat, threw off my shoes and
went in after her. The water was so icy I could
hardly swim at first. When I did get hold of her
it was a battle royal to get her back to the pier.
She was so weighted down by the fur coat and she
struggled so fiercely that several times I thought
we were both going down. Mrs. Anderson threw us
a plank and with its help I finally got her to the
pier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now run for your life!&rdquo; I ordered, my own
teeth chattering in my head. &ldquo;Drop that wet coat
and I&rsquo;ll race you to the house.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t move
nearly fast enough to avoid a chill and I took hold
of her hand and pulled her along.</p>
<p>Up in a cosy bedroom in the Randall&rsquo;s house we
sat up, some hours later, wrapped in blankets, and
looked at each other gravely. Mrs. Anderson had
been in and talked with Ethel like a big sister about
the cheapness of carrying on flirtations with strange
boys. Ethel had seen her little affair in its true
light, robbed of all romance, and shame had taken
hold of her. Mrs. Anderson explained how the
gallant Romeo had seen his Juliet fall into the pond
and had fled basely in the other direction for fear
he would be blamed, making no effort to rescue her,
and she might have been drowned if I hadn&rsquo;t fished
her out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>Ethel had been frightened out of her wits when
she fell into the water; she was still suffering from
the shock. She flushed hotly as she caught my
glance, and cast down her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Brewster, for saving my life,&rdquo;
she said rather shame-facedly. Then she went on
in a low tone, &ldquo;I want to tell you something. I
wrote that letter to Mr. Butler,&mdash;the one that made
mamma so angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; I answered gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew, and you jumped into the water after
me anyway?&rdquo; she said in a tone of unbelief. &ldquo;Why,
you might have let me drown as easy as not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O no, I mightn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the
way a Camp Fire Girl gets even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel was silent a long while. Then she said,
&ldquo;Will you come back to our house after I have told
mother the whole thing? She misses you a lot, says
she never had anyone do her work so well as you
did it, and she has been in a terrible temper ever
since you left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I answered slowly. I had been
very deeply hurt and my foolish pride was still on
its hind legs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will you please come?&rdquo; pleaded Ethel, slipping
out of her chair and putting her arms around me.
&ldquo;We can have such good times after your work
hours. Please, for my sake, I want you. You&rsquo;re
the most wonderful girl I&rsquo;ve ever met!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Mr. Pride and I had a final round and we
came out with me sitting on his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come
back,&rdquo; I said, slipping my arm around Ethel.</p>
<p>So you see, Katherine, adventure isn&rsquo;t dead, not
by any means, even if you do have to take it along
with your bread and butter.</p>

<h3>KATHERINE TO THE WINNEBAGOS</h3>
<p><span class="date">April 8, 19&mdash;.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Dearest Winnies:</span></p>
<p>Daggers and dirks! Did I say it was dull out
here? Deluded mortal! For the past week it&rsquo;s
been so strenuous that I have seriously considered
moving to Bedlam for a rest. If I&rsquo;m not gray by
the time I&rsquo;m thirty it&rsquo;ll be because I&rsquo;m bald.</p>
<p>As Mistress of Ceremonies your humble servant
is a rather watery success. You know from sad
experience my fatal fondness for trying new and
startling experiments and also my genius for leaving
the most important things undone. Remember
the time I was Lemonade Committee when we
climbed Windy Hill and I carefully provided water
and sugar and spoons and glasses, and no lemons?
And the time I hid the unwashed dishes in the oven
at Aunt Anna&rsquo;s and then went home with Gladys
and forgot all about them, and Aunt Anna nearly
had spasms because she thought her silverware had
been stolen? And the time we went to Ellen&rsquo;s Isle
and I mislaid the vital portion of my traveling suit
half an hour before the train started and had to go
in a borrowed suit that didn&rsquo;t fit? Every time little
Katherine was given something to do she either
forgot to do it altogether, or else did it in such a
way as to make herself ridiculous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>The memory of all those things rose up and oppressed
me after I had undertaken to stage a Patriotic
Pageant for the township of Spencer. I was
so afraid I would do something that would turn it
into a farce that I began to have nightmares the
minute I sank to weary slumber. It was a daring
idea, this patriotic pageant. Since history began
there had never been a pageant, patriotic or otherwise,
in this section. Most of the folks had never
seen a circus, or a show, or a parade; so there was
nobody to give me any help except Justice. I myself
would never have thought of tackling it, but no
sooner had my Camp Fire Girls gotten absorbed in
Red Cross work, and been thrilled by reading accounts
of what Camp Fire Girls were doing in other
sections, than they begged me to get up a pageant.
I had my misgivings, but, being a Winnebago, I
couldn&rsquo;t back out. A pageant it should be, if it
cost my head. (It pretty nearly did, but not in the
way I had feared.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>Justice Sherman hailed the plan with delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to it,&rdquo; he encouraged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you to the
bitter end. I&rsquo;ve never done it before but I&rsquo;ll never
begin any younger.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;There is a tide in the affairs of schoolma&rsquo;ams,</p>
<p class="t0">That, taken at the flood, leads on to Pageants.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lead on MacDuff! Trot out the order of events.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Justice&rsquo;s suggestion I summed up all the possibilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much to work with,&rdquo; I said thoughtfully,
having counted up all my assets on the fingers
of one hand. &ldquo;Just ten Camp Fire Girls, about as
many boys, one trick mule, and&mdash;you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So glad I know, right at the outset, just where
I come in,&rdquo; said Justice politely, &ldquo;after the mule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandhelo&rsquo;s got his red, white and blue pompom
that the girls sent him for Christmas,&rdquo; I went on,
ignoring Justice&rsquo;s gibe. &ldquo;We could make red, white
and blue harness for him, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only he doesn&rsquo;t get temperamental!&rdquo; said
Justice fervently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The girls could wear their Red Cross caps and
aprons in one part of it,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;and flags
draped on them when they act out &lsquo;The Spirit of
Columbia.&rsquo; One of the girls can wear her Ceremonial
gown and be the Spirit of Nature that comes
to tell the others the secret of the soil that will help
them win the war. Oh, ideas are coming to me
faster than flies to molasses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you advise me to wear my Ceremonial
gown or my Red Cross apron and cap?&rdquo; asked
Justice soberly. &ldquo;I could braid my hair in two pig-tails&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Justice!&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;if you only had a
soldier&rsquo;s uniform!&rdquo; Then, as I saw Justice wince
and the laughter die out of his eyes, I stopped
abruptly and changed the subject. It was an awfully
sore point with him that he had been rejected for
the army.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a flag raising, of course, and tableaux,&rdquo;
I rushed on. &ldquo;Would you put the flag on
the schoolhouse, or set up a pole in the ground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think on the schoolhouse,&rdquo; said Justice, with a
return of interest. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where it belongs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>Justice and I held more conferences in the next
day or so than the King and his Prime Minister.
Lessons in the little schoolhouse were abandoned
while we drilled and rehearsed for the pageant.
Justice and I put together and bought the flag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to raise it?&rdquo; asked Justice, shaking
the beautiful bright starry folds out of the package.</p>
<p>I considered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the pupil that has the best record in
school should raise it,&rdquo; suggested Justice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; I said slowly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let Absalom Butts
raise it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absalom Butts!&rdquo; exclaimed Justice incredulously.
&ldquo;The laziest, meanest, most mischievous
boy in school! I wouldn&rsquo;t let him be in the pageant,
if I had my way, let alone raise the flag.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; I said calmly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just like the
rest of them. That&rsquo;s the whole trouble with Absalom
Butts. He&rsquo;s been used to harsh measures all
his life. His father has cuffed him about ever
since he can remember. Everybody considers him
a bad boy and a terror to snakes and all that and
now he acts the part thoroughly. He&rsquo;s so homely
that nobody will ever be attracted to him by his
looks, and such a poor scholar that he will never
make a name for himself at his lessons, and the
only way he can make himself prominent is through
his pranks. He&rsquo;s too old to be in school with the
rest of the children; he should be with boys of his
own age. His father makes him stay there because
he is too obstinate to admit that he will never get
out by the graduation route, and Absalom takes out
his spite on the teacher. I can read him like a
book. I&rsquo;ve tried fighting him to a finish on every
point and it hasn&rsquo;t worked. He&rsquo;s still ready to break
out at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Now I&rsquo;m going to change
my tactics. I&rsquo;m going to appoint him, as the oldest
pupil, to be my special aid in the pageant, and help
work out the details. I&rsquo;m going to honor him by
letting him raise the flag. We&rsquo;ll see how that will
change his mind about playing pranks to spoil the
pageant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; said Justice gloomily. &ldquo;Absalom
Butts is Absalom Butts, the son of Elijah Butts;
and a chip off the old block. The old man has a
mean, crafty disposition, and he probably was just
like Absalom when he was young. Absalom is going
to do something to spoil that pageant, I see it in
his eye. You watch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth trying, anyhow,&rdquo; I said determinedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; reiterated Justice. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
change human nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It worked once,&rdquo; I said, and I told him about
the Dalrymple twins, Antha and Anthony, last
summer on Ellen&rsquo;s Isle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you turned little Cry-baby into a lion of
bravery and Sir Boastful into a modest violet!&rdquo; said
Justice, in a tone of incredulity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and if you&rsquo;d ever seen them at the beginning
of the summer you wouldn&rsquo;t have held any
high hopes of changing human nature, either,&rdquo; I
remarked, a little nettled at Justice&rsquo;s tone.</p>
<p>Justice started to reply, but was seized with a
violent fit of coughing that left him leaning weakly
against the door. I looked at him in some alarm.
I knew it was throat trouble that had kept him
out of the army, but it hadn&rsquo;t seemed to be anything
to worry about&mdash;just a dry, hacking cough
from time to time. Now, standing out there in the
brilliant sunshine, he looked very white and
haggard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all tired out, you&rsquo;ve been working too
hard,&rdquo; I said, remembering how he had been putting
in time after school hours working in Elijah Butts&rsquo;
cotton storehouse, because it was impossible to get
enough men to handle the cotton. Then, by drilling
my boys and girls by the hour in military marching
and running countless errands for me&mdash;poor
Justice was in danger of being sacrificed on the
altar of my ambition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a selfish thing!&rdquo; I said vehemently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Justice, holding up his head and
beginning to fold up the flag. &ldquo;I got choked with
dust, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; Manlike, he hated to display any
sign of physical weakness before a girl. I decided
to say no more about it, but I knew he needed rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down a minute,&rdquo; I said artfully, sinking
down on the doorsill, &ldquo;and keep me &rsquo;mused. I&rsquo;m
tired to death. Tell me all the news in the Metropolis
of Spencer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Justice fell into the trap. He sat down beside me
and launched into a lively imitation of Elijah Butts
convincing the school board that the old school
books were better than the new ones some venturous
soul had suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If he only knew how you took him off behind
his back, he wouldn&rsquo;t confide in you so trustingly,&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what comes of being a bargain,&rdquo; replied
Justice loftily. &ldquo;Great ones linger in my presence,
anxious to breathe the same air. The Board coddles
me like a rare bit of old china and proudly exhibits
me to visitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by the way,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I hear there&rsquo;s a
stranger in town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked up with interest. &ldquo;Fine or superfine?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Superfine,&rdquo; replied Justice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where from?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like Shelley&rsquo;s immortal soul,&rdquo; replied Justice
solemnly, &ldquo;she cometh from afar. She cometh to
study Rural School Conditions&mdash;sent out by some
Commission or other. She&rsquo;s likely to visit your
school. Thought I&rsquo;d tell you ahead of time so you&rsquo;d
manage to be on the premises when the delegation
arrived. She might object to hunting through the
woods for you.&rdquo; Here we were both overcome with
laughter at the remembrance of the last &ldquo;visitation&rdquo;
of the school board.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t figure out yet why I wasn&rsquo;t fired,&rdquo; said
I, flicking a sociable spider off my lap with the stem
of a leaf. &ldquo;I would have been willing to bet my
eyebrows on it that night. What made them change
their minds, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was because they hated to lose the
bargain,&rdquo; answered Justice, half to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hated to lose what bargain?&rdquo; I asked innocently.
Then suddenly I understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Justice Sherman!&rdquo; I exclaimed, starting up.
&ldquo;Did you threaten to leave if they discharged me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Justice turned crimson and became reticent.
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know as I threatened them exactly,&rdquo;
he replied in a soothing drawl. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t look very
threatening, now, do I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Justice,&rdquo; was all I could say, for at the
thought of what he had done for me I was stricken
dumb.</p>
<p>Verily the power of the Bargain was great in the
land!</p>
<p>The pageant grew under our hands until it assumed
really respectable proportions. The girls and
boys were wild about it and drilled tirelessly by the
hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had a better parade ground,&rdquo; sighed
Justice regretfully, squinting at the small level plot
of ground in front of the schoolhouse that was worn
bare of grass. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t room to make a really
effective showing with our drill. If only the old
schoolhouse wasn&rsquo;t in the way we could use the space
that&rsquo;s behind it and on both sides of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then that I had one of my old-time, wild
inspirations. &ldquo;Move the schoolhouse back,&rdquo; I said
calmly.</p>
<p>Justice shouted. &ldquo;Why not roll up the road and
set it down on the other side of field?&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we couldn&rsquo;t move the schoolhouse
back,&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;Why not, if it&rsquo;s in the
way? It&rsquo;s no ornament, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half-amused, half-serious, Justice looked first at
me and then at the little one-story shack that went
by the name of schoolhouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! we can do it!&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be no trick at all. Just get her up on rollers
and hitch Sandhelo to the pulley rope and let him
wind her up. Just like that. An&rsquo; zay say ze French
have no sense of ze delicasse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will the Board say?&rdquo; I inquired, half
fearfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t ask the Board,&rdquo; replied Justice
calmly. &ldquo;Move first, ask for orders afterwards,
that&rsquo;s the way the great generals win battles. Remember
how General Sherman cut the wires between
him and Washington when he started out on
his famous march to the sea, so that no short-sighted
one could wire him to change his plans?
Well, we&rsquo;re out to make this pageant a success, and
we aren&rsquo;t going to risk it by stopping to ask too
much permission. We&rsquo;ll move the schoolhouse first
and ask permission afterward. By that time it&rsquo;ll
be too late; the pageant is to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And we did move it. If you had ever seen us!
It wasn&rsquo;t such a job as you might think. I suppose
the word &ldquo;schoolhouse&rdquo; conjures up in your mind
the brick and granite pile that is Washington High&mdash;imagine
moving that out of the way to make room
for a military drill! &rsquo;Vantage number one for our
school. We also have our points of superiority, it
seems.</p>
<p>The old shack looked vastly better where we
finally let it rest. There was a clump of bushes
alongside that hid some of its battered boards beautifully.
The parade ground seemed about three
times as big as it had been before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more like it,&rdquo; said Justice approvingly.
&ldquo;Now we can turn around without stubbing our
toes against the schoolhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will Mr. Butts say?&rdquo; I asked, beginning
to have cold chills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait until that gets between the wind and
his nobility!&rdquo; chuckled Justice. &ldquo;Never mind, I&rsquo;ll
take all the blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when the crisis came, and Elijah
Butts came driving up on the afternoon of the
great occasion, I was there to face the music alone,
Justice being nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Butts arrived in state, bringing
with them a strange lady, who I figured out must
be the one Justice had told me about, the one who,
like Shelley&rsquo;s immortal soul, had come from afar
and was sent by a Commission to study rural school
conditions.</p>
<p>I glanced wildly about to see if Justice were not
hovering protectingly near, but there was no sign of
him. However, I knew my duties as hostess. Nonchalantly
I strolled over to the road to welcome the
newcomers. Elijah Butts had just finished tying
his horse and, bristling with importance, had turned
to help the Commission Lady out of the rig.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah-h, Miss Fairlee,&rdquo; he said in smooth tones,
&ldquo;this is&mdash;ah&mdash;Miss Adams, our teacher at the Corners
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he suddenly jumped half out of his boots
and stared over my shoulder as if he had seen a
ghost. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that schoolhouse?&rdquo; he demanded,
in a voice which seemed to indicate he thought I
had it in my pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s right over there,&rdquo; I said calmly, pointing
toward the bushes.</p>
<p>Elijah Butts&rsquo; eyes followed my fingers in a fascinated
way; he could hardly believe his senses.
&ldquo;How did it get there?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We moved it back,&rdquo; I replied casually. &ldquo;It was
in the way of the maneuvers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elijah Butts sputtered, choked, and was speechless.</p>
<p>But Miss Fairlee, the Commission lady, laughed
until she had to grip the side of the buggy for support.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the funniest thing I ever heard,&rdquo; she
gasped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of the Mountain coming to
Mahomet, but I never heard of the Mountain getting
out of the road for Mahomet. Oh, Mr. Butts,
I think the West is delightful. You people are <i>so</i>
original and forceful!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>That took the wind out of Mr. Butts&rsquo; sails.
What could he do after that neat little speech but
take the compliment to himself and pass the matter
off lightly?</p>
<p>The pageant was a wonderful success in spite of
my misgivings. I didn&rsquo;t forget to hand the torch
to Columbia at the right moment and I didn&rsquo;t forget
to bring the brown stockings for little Lizzie
Cooper, who was the Spirit of Nature, and I made
fire with the bow and drill without any mishap.
But one thing was a dreadful disappointment to me.
Absalom Butts was not there, and I had no chance
to work out my experiment on him. Where he was
I couldn&rsquo;t imagine. I had taken Clarissa home with
me the night before to help me finish some things
and she hadn&rsquo;t seen him since he went home from
school; Mr. Butts also said he didn&rsquo;t know. He
added, in a voice loud enough for Miss Fairlee to
hear, that he would lick the tar out of him for not
being in the patriotic pageant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>No one knew that I had picked Absalom in my
mind to raise the flag. There had been much speculation
about who was to have this honor and in order
to keep everybody happy I said I would not announce
this until the moment came. Then I
planned to make a speech and award the honor to
Absalom, thus singling him out for something besides
punishment for once in his life. I had had
him helping me for several days, and given him
certain definite things to do on the great occasion
and was much disappointed that he didn&rsquo;t come to
do them. Justice&rsquo;s warning came back and I had
an uneasy feeling that he was in hiding somewhere,
plotting mischief.</p>
<p>I had a real inspiration, though, in regard to the
flag raising. In a flowery speech I called upon Mr.
Elijah Butts, the &ldquo;President of the School Board
and the most influential man in Spencer Township,&rdquo;
to perform that rite. He swelled up until he almost
burst, like the frog in the fable, as he stood
there, conscious of Miss Fairlee&rsquo;s eye on him, with
his great hairy hand on the pulley rope. Round the
corner of the schoolhouse and hidden from view by
the bush, I caught Justice Sherman&rsquo;s eye and he
applauded silently with his two forefingers, meaning
to say that it was a master stroke on my part.
Then he dropped his eye decorously and started the
singing of the National Anthem.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>The pageant ended up in a picnic supper eaten on
the erstwhile parade ground, and then the people
began to go home through the softly falling dusk.
Miss Fairlee came to me and complimented me on
the success of the pageant and asked to take some
notes for future use; and Elijah Butts was quite
cordial as he departed. I&rsquo;ve discovered something
to-day; if you want to win a person&rsquo;s undying affection,
single him out as the most important member
of the bunch. He&rsquo;ll fall for it every time. You
note that I am talking about male persons, now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the show&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; said Justice, when the
last of the audience had departed. &ldquo;Now the actors
can take it easy. Come on, let&rsquo;s get Sandhelo and
go for a ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We climbed into the little cart, still covered with
its pageant finery, and drove slowly down the dusty
road, discussing the events of the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Justice,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;did you ever see anything so
touching as the pride some of those poor women
took in their boys and girls? They fairly glowed,
some of them. And did you see that one poor
woman who tried to fix herself up for the occasion?
She had nothing to wear but her faded old blue
calico dress, but she had pinned a bunch of roses on
the front of it to make herself look festive.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve started something, I think,&rdquo; said Justice
thoughtfully. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve taught the people how to get
together and have a good time, and they like it.
They&rsquo;ll be doing it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; I replied. Then I added, &ldquo;I wonder
where Absalom was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, your scheme didn&rsquo;t work after all,&rdquo;
said Justice, in an I-told-you-so tone of voice.
&ldquo;Absalom wasn&rsquo;t impressed with the honor of being
your right-hand man. He took the occasion to
play hookey. It&rsquo;s a wonder he didn&rsquo;t try to play
some trick on the rest of us; but I suppose he didn&rsquo;t
dare, with his father there. He&rsquo;s afraid to draw a
crooked breath when the old man&rsquo;s around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m disappointed,&rdquo; I said pensively, leaning my
head back and letting the cool wind blow the hair
away from my face. It had been a strenuous day
and I was tired out. The strain of being afraid
every minute that I would do something ridiculous
or had left something undone that was of vital
importance had nearly turned my hair grey. Now
that it was all over without mishap, the people had
enjoyed it and my Camp Fire girls had covered
themselves with glory, I relaxed into a delicious
tranquillity and gave myself over to enjoyment of
the quiet drive in the sweet evening air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why so deucedly pensive?&rdquo; inquired Justice,
after we had jogged along for some minutes in
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just thanking whatever gods there be that I
didn&rsquo;t make a holy show of myself somehow,&rdquo; I
replied lazily. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this evening peaceful, though?
Who would ever think that down around the other
side of this sweet smelling earth men are killing each
other like flies, and the night is hideous with the din
of warfare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Above us the big white stars twinkled serenely,
approvingly; all nature seemed in tune with my
placid mood. Justice fell under the spell of it, too,
and leaned back in silent enjoyment.</p>
<p>What was that sudden glare that shone out
against the sky, over to the south? That red, lurid
glare that dimmed the glory of the stars and threw
buildings and barns into black relief?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cotton storehouse!&rdquo; exclaimed Justice in a
horrified voice. &ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>For once Sandhelo responded to my urging without
argument, and we soon arrived on the scene of
the blaze. Elijah Butts&rsquo; plantation is about three
miles from Spencer, and no water but the well and
the cistern. &ldquo;This is going to be a nice mess,&rdquo; said
Justice, jumping out of the car and charging into
the throng of gaping negroes who stood around
watching the spectacle. The family of Butts had
not returned from the pageant yet, having taken
Miss Fairlee for a drive in the opposite direction.
A few neighbors had gathered, but they stood there,
gaping like the negroes and not lifting a hand to save
the cotton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you, get busy!&rdquo; shouted Justice, taking
command like a general. Under his direction a
bucket brigade was formed to check the flames as
much as possible and keep the surrounding sheds
from taking fire. &ldquo;Go through the barn and bring
out the horses and cows, if there are any there,&rdquo; he
called to me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>I obeyed, and brought out one poor trembling
bossy, the only livestock I found. Then Justice
turned the command of the bucket brigade over to
me and started in with one or two helpers to remove
the cotton from the end of the storehouse
that was not yet ablaze. He worked like a Trojan,
his face blackened with smoke until it was hard to
tell him from the negroes, the remains of his pageant
costume hanging about him in tatters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody started this fire on purpose,&rdquo; he
panted as he paused beside me a moment to clear his
lungs of smoke. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been oil poured on the
cotton!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at that moment the Butts family returned,
driving into the yard at a gallop. Mr. Butts&rsquo; wrath
and excitement knew no bounds and he was hardly
able to help effectively; he ran around for all the
world like a chicken with its head off. Assistance
came swiftly as people began to arrive from far
and near, attracted by the blaze, but if it hadn&rsquo;t
been for Justice&rsquo;s timely taking hold of the situation
not a bit of the cotton would have been saved,
and the house, barn and sheds would have gone
up, too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Conjectures began to fly thick and fast on all
sides as to how the fire had started, and a whisper
began going the rounds that soon became an open
accusation. One of the negroes that works for Mr.
Butts swore he saw Absalom going into the storehouse
that afternoon. My heart skipped a beat.
He had not been at the celebration. Was this where
he had been and what he had done the while?
Elijah Butts was stamping up and down in such a
fury as I had never seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t get out!&rdquo; he shouted hoarsely to
the group that stood around him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s locked in
the woodshed, I locked him in there myself, and
there isn&rsquo;t even a window he could get out of!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I started at his words. So that was where Absalom
had been that afternoon. He hadn&rsquo;t deliberately
disappointed me, then. But&mdash;Elijah Butts
hadn&rsquo;t said that afternoon that he had locked Absalom
up at home. He had pretended to be much
mystified over the non-appearance of his son. Why
had he done so? The answer came in a flash of
intuition. Elijah Butts had probably had a set-to
with Absalom over some private affair and had
locked him up as punishment, but he didn&rsquo;t want
Miss Fairlee to know that he had kept him out of
the patriotic pageant and so he had denied any
knowledge of Absalom&rsquo;s whereabouts. &ldquo;The old
hypocrite!&rdquo; I said to myself scornfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your woodshed&rsquo;s wide open,&rdquo; said someone from
the crowd. &ldquo;We were in there looking for a bucket.
The door was open and there wasn&rsquo;t nobody in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got out!&rdquo; shouted Elijah Butts in still greater
fury. &ldquo;He got out and set fire to the cotton to
spite me! Wait until I catch him! Wait till I get
my hands on him!&rdquo; He stamped up and down,
shouting threats against his son, awful to listen to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he&rsquo;d drive that boy to turn against
him yet,&rdquo; said Justice, drawing me away to a quiet
spot, and mopping his black forehead with a damp
handkerchief. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say but that it served him
right. After all, Absalom is a chip off the old
block. That&rsquo;s his idea of getting even. He didn&rsquo;t
stop to think that it was the government&rsquo;s loss as
well as his father&rsquo;s. Well, it&rsquo;s all over but the
shouting; we might as well go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We drove home in silence. Justice was tuckered
out, I could see that, and I began to worry for fear
his strenuous efforts would lay him up. I was still
too much excited to feel tired. That would come
later. All my energy was concentrated into disappointment
over Absalom Butts. I couldn&rsquo;t believe
that he was really as bad as this. I didn&rsquo;t want to
believe he had done it, and yet it seemed all too
true. Why had he run away if he hadn&rsquo;t? I shook
my head. It was beyond me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>Silently we drove into the yard and unhitched
Sandhelo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said Justice, starting off in the
direction of his cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; I replied absently. I did not go
right into the house. I was wide awake and knew
I could not go to sleep for some time. Instead I
sat in the doorway and blinked at the moon, like a
touseled-haired owl. It was after midnight and
everything was still, even the wind. Out of the
corner of my eye I watched Justice wearily plodding
along to his sleeping quarters, saw him open the
screen door and vanish from sight within. Then,
borne clearly on the night air, I heard an exclamation
come from his lips, then a frightened cry. I
sped down the path like the wind to the little cabin.
A lamp flared out in the darkness just as I reached
it and by its light I saw Justice bending over something
in a corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; I called through the screen
door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Justice turned around with a start. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s
you, is it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went in. There, crouched in a corner on the
floor, was Absalom Butts, his eyes blinking in the
sudden light, his face like a scared rabbit&rsquo;s. It was
he who had cried out, not Justice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble, Absalom,&rdquo; said I, trying to
speak in a natural tone of voice, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you find
your way home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dassent go home,&rdquo; replied Absalom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa&rsquo;ll kill me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I ran away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve run away, have you?&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because pa licked me and locked me in the woodshed
and wouldn&rsquo;t let me come to the doin&rsquo;s this
afternoon, and I just wouldn&rsquo;t stand it, so I got
out and cut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you get out?&rdquo; I asked, leaning forward
a trifle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This afternoon,&rdquo; replied Absalom. &ldquo;I thought
first I&rsquo;d come to the doin&rsquo;s anyhow and help you
with those things I&rsquo;d promised, but I was scared
to come with pa there, so I went the other way.
I walked and walked and walked, till I was tired out
and most starved, because I hadn&rsquo;t brought anything
along to eat, and I didn&rsquo;t know where I was
headed for, anyway, and then I came along here
and saw this shack and came in and sat down to
rest. I must a fell asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t do it, then?&rdquo; said I, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; Absalom&rsquo;s tone was plainly bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set fire to your father&rsquo;s cotton storehouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whee-e-e-e-e!&rdquo; Absalom&rsquo;s whistle of astonishment
was clearly genuine. &ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who did?&rdquo; asked Justice, watching
him keenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Did</i> somebody?&rdquo; asked Absalom innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say they did,&rdquo; said Justice, puzzled in
his turn. &ldquo;Are you sure you don&rsquo;t know anything
about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Absalom shook his head vigorously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know anything about it,&rdquo; he said straightforwardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sure you didn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; I said triumphantly.
&ldquo;I had a feeling in my bones.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How does it happen that you weren&rsquo;t at the
fire?&rdquo; asked Justice wonderingly. &ldquo;You must have
seen the glare in the sky. People came for miles
around. Didn&rsquo;t you see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Absalom shook his head. &ldquo;I must a slept through
it,&rdquo; he said simply, and followed it with such a large
sigh of regret for what he had missed that Justice
and I both had to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s one thing about it,&rdquo; said Justice,
&ldquo;and that is, if you <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> set fire to it, you&rsquo;d better
streak it for home about as fast as you can and
clear yourself up. Everybody thinks you did it and
your running away made it look suspicious. Besides,
one of your father&rsquo;s men says he saw you
coming out of the storehouse this afternoon. By
the way, what <i>were</i> you doing in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Absalom met his gaze unwaveringly. &ldquo;Me?
Why, I went in there to get my knife, that I&rsquo;d left
in there yesterday. I couldn&rsquo;t go away without
my knife, could I?&rdquo; He pulled it from his pocket
and gazed on it fondly,&mdash;an ugly old &ldquo;toad stabber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, you weren&rsquo;t smoking any cigarettes in
there, and dropped a lighted stub, perhaps?&rdquo; asked
Justice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Absalom, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t smokin&rsquo; to-day.
I do sometimes, though,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t seem to be the villain, after all,&rdquo;
said Justice, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m mighty glad to hear it. So
will a lot of people be. Things looked pretty bad
for you this afternoon, Absalom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest?&rdquo; asked Absalom. &ldquo;Do folks really
think I set fire to it? What did pa say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Justice laughed. &ldquo;What he isn&rsquo;t going to do to
you when he catches you won&rsquo;t be worth doing,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Absalom began to look apprehensive. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid to go back,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you afraid of, if you didn&rsquo;t do it?&rdquo;
asked Justice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa wouldn&rsquo;t believe me,&rdquo; said Absalom nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess he&rsquo;ll believe you all right,&rdquo; I said
soothingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go with me,&rdquo; begged Absalom, eyeing us
both beseechingly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll believe you. He never
believes me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we had better,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;He can stay
here with you the rest of the night and we&rsquo;ll drive
over the first thing in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>The next morning bright and early found us
again on the scene of the fire. Early as we were,
we found Elijah Butts poking in the ashes of his
cotton crop with a wrathful countenance. When
he saw us coming he strode to meet us and without
a word laid hold of Absalom&rsquo;s collar. His expression
was like that of a fox who has caught his
goose after many hours of waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you, you rascal,&rdquo; he sputtered, shaking
Absalom until his teeth chattered. &ldquo;Where did you
find him?&rdquo; he demanded of Justice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my bunk,&rdquo; replied Justice, laying a hand on
Mr. Butts&rsquo; arm and trying to separate him from
his son. &ldquo;He had been there all evening, and knew
nothing about the fire. He didn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Butts. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell
me he didn&rsquo;t do it. Of course he did it! Who else
did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t prepared to answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Absalom didn&rsquo;t do it, Mr. Butts,&rdquo; said
Justice earnestly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d stake a whole lot on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t, you can better believe!&rdquo; answered
Mr. Butts. &ldquo;He did it, and I&rsquo;m going to
take it out of him.&rdquo; He began to march Absalom
off toward the house, urging him along with a box
on the ear that nearly felled him to the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>Justice did it so quickly that I never will be able
to tell just what it was, but in a minute there stood
Elijah Butts rubbing his wrist and wearing the most
surprised look I ever saw on the face of a man, and
there sat Absalom on the ground half a dozen yards
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beat it back to our shack, Absalom,&rdquo; called
Justice. &ldquo;I guess the climate&rsquo;s a little too hot
around here for you just yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Absalom needed no second bidding. He sped
down the road away from his paternal mansion as
if the whole German army was after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you can treat your son like a human being
he&rsquo;ll come back,&rdquo; said Justice to Mr. Butts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t need to come back,&rdquo; said Mr. Butts
sourly, but with fury carefully toned down. Justice&rsquo;s
use of an uncanny Japanese wrestling trick to
wrench Absalom out of his vise-like grasp had created
a vast respect in him. He wasn&rsquo;t quite sure
what Justice was going to do next, and eyed him
warily for a possible attack in the rear. &ldquo;He
don&rsquo;t need to come back,&rdquo; he mumbled stubbornly,
&ldquo;until he either says he did it and takes what&rsquo;s
coming to him, or finds out who did do it.&rdquo; Growling
to himself he went toward the house and we
drove off to overtake Absalom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Daggers and dirks!&rdquo; exclaimed Justice. &ldquo;Old
Butts sure is some knotty piece of timber to drive
screws into!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a rather dejected trio that Sandhelo, frisking
in the morning air, carried back to the house.
Justice, I could see, was trying to figure out by
calculus the probable result of having jiu-jitsu-ed
the president of the school board; I was sorry for
Absalom and Absalom was sorry for himself. Once
I caught him looking at me pleadingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> don&rsquo;t think I done it?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for a minute!&rdquo; I answered heartily, smiling
into his eyes.</p>
<p>He looked down, in a shame-faced way, and then
he suddenly put his arm around my neck. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry I treated you so horrid,&rdquo; he murmured.
Think of it! Absalom, the bully, the one-time bane
of my existence, the fly in the ointment, riding down
the road with his arm around my neck, and me
standing up for him against the world! Don&rsquo;t
things turn out queerly, though? Who would ever
have thought it possible, six months ago?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>Absalom and I had quite a few long talks in the
days that followed. He confided to me his hatred
of lessons and his ambition to raise horses. Father
let him help him as much as he liked, and promised
him a job on the place any time he wanted it.
Absalom seemed utterly transformed. He fooled
around the horses day and night and showed a
knack of handling them that proved beyond a doubt
that he had chosen his profession wisely. I did not
insist upon his going to school and was glad I
hadn&rsquo;t; for in a day or two came the &ldquo;visitation&rdquo;
of the Board, bringing Miss Fairlee to see my
school.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>She was absolutely enchanted with the way we
conducted things; gasped with astonishment at the
graphophone and the lantern slides; exclaimed in
wonder at the library; listened approvingly to the
reading lesson, which was from one of the current
magazines; partook generously of our dinner,
cooked and served in the most approved style, and
laughed heartily at the stunts we did afterward by
way of entertainment. I took a naughty satisfaction
in showing off my changed curriculum for her
approval and watching the effect it had on the
august Board members. None of them knew
exactly what I had been doing all this time, and
their amazement was immense. Mr. Butts did not
come with the board this time, so I was spared the
embarrassment of meeting him. Without him the
rest of the Board were like sheep that had gotten
separated from the bell-wether; they didn&rsquo;t know
which direction to head into until Miss Fairlee expressed
her unqualified approval of my methods;
then they all endorsed it emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I were a pupil again, so I could have
you for a teacher!&rdquo; said Miss Fairlee when school
was out, and I considered that the highest compliment
I had ever received. I immediately invited
her to attend our Ceremonial Meeting that night
and she accepted the invitation eagerly. We held
it on the old parade ground in front of the school.
In honor of our guest we acted out the pretty Indian
legend of Kir-a-wa and the Blackbirds and when
we came to the place where we rush out looking
for the two crows we found two real ones sitting
on the fence, only, instead of attacking us as the
ones did in the legend, these two applauded vigorously.
They were Justice and Absalom, come with
Sandhelo and the cart to take me home, or rather
what was left of me after the blackbirds had picked
me to pieces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Another day gone without mishap!&rdquo; I said, as
Justice slid back the stable door and I walked in
with my arm around Sandhelo&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;Sandhelo
will have to have a lump of sugar and an extra soft
bed to celebrate. Come on, Sandy, let me tuck
you in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sandhelo would not enter his stall. He stuck
his head in, sniffed the air, and then, with a squeal
that always heralds an outbreak of temperament,
he rose on his hind legs and began to dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever has gotten into him?&rdquo; I began, tugging
at his tail, which was the nearest thing I could
get my hand onto, when suddenly a wild shriek rose
up from under our very feet and in the dimness of
the stall we saw something roll over and crouch in
a corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, the lantern!&rdquo; said Justice.</p>
<p>But we couldn&rsquo;t find it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Then from the depths of the stall there came a
voice, crying in terrified tones, &ldquo;Don&rsquo; take me, mister
Debble; don&rsquo; take me, mister Debble, I done it,
I done it; I set fiah to &rsquo;at ole cotton to get even
with old Mister Butts fer settin&rsquo; de dawgs on me; I
done it, I done it; go &rsquo;way, Mister Debble, don&rsquo;
take me, I&rsquo;ll tell dem; only don&rsquo; take me, Mister
Debble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Justice and Absalom and I stood frozen to the
spot, listening to this remarkable outcry. Then
Justice raised the lantern, which he just spied on
the floor, and lighting it held it in the stall. By its
flickering rays we saw a negro crouching in the
corner, whose rolling eyes and trembling limbs
showed him to be beside himself with fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory!&rdquo; exclaimed Justice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same old
bird we saw in the road that day, the one I said
looked like mischief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Sandhelo, nosing me aside, looked inquisitively
over my shoulder and the darky immediately
went into another spasm of fright, covering his
face with his hands and imploring &ldquo;Mister Debble&rdquo;
not to take him this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whee-e-e-e-!&rdquo; said Justice, whistling in his astonishment.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the one that fired the cotton and
now he thinks Sandhelo is the devil coming after
him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy, what an awful creature!&rdquo; said I, shuddering
and looking the other way. &ldquo;If Sandhelo gets
a good look at him I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll return the compliment
about taking him for His Satanic Nibs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one way you can keep him from
getting you,&rdquo; said Justice to the darky gravely.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s by going to Mr. Butts and telling him yourself
that you did it. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s good-bye,
Solomon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Sandhelo, as if he understood what was
going on, suddenly snapped at the black legs
stretched out across his stall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him, I&rsquo;ll tell him!&rdquo; shuddered Solomon,
and with a prolonged howl of terror he fled from
the stable and down the road in the direction of the
Butts plantation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll tell him all right,&rdquo; chuckled Justice.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll face a dozen Elijah Buttses, before he lets
the devil get him. Poor Sandhelo! Rather rough
on him, though, to have his name used as a terror
to evil doers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talk about nothing ever happening around here!
O you darling Winnebagos, with your ladylike advantages,
and your mildly eventful lives, you don&rsquo;t
know what real excitement is!</p>

<h3>GLADYS TO KATHERINE</h3>
<p><span class="date">April 10, 19&mdash;.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Dearest old K:</span></p>
<p>The Winnebagos have scored again, although it
did take us nearly all year to make this particular
basket. I know that if you had been here, you old
miracle worker, you would have found the way
before the first month had passed, but, not having
your gift for seeing right through people&rsquo;s starched
shirtwaists and straight into their hearts, we had to
wait for chance to show us the way. And it turned
out the way it usually does for the Winnebagos&mdash;we
stooped to pick up a common little stone and
found a pearl of great price. Of course, now there
are lots of people who would like to be the setting
for that pearl, but she belongs to the Winnebagos
by right of discovery and we mean to keep her for
our very own. For, after all, who but the Winnebagos
could have discovered Sally Prindle, when up
to that very week, day, hour and minute she hadn&rsquo;t
even discovered herself? The chances are that she
never would have, either, and what a shame it would
have been!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>You remember my telling about Sally Prindle
long ago, the time we tried to fix up her room for
her and she wouldn&rsquo;t let us? Of course she hurt
our feelings, because we hadn&rsquo;t been trying to
patronize her and didn&rsquo;t deserve to be snubbed, but
we got over it in a day or two and saw her side of
it. It probably <i>was</i> annoying to have three separate
delegations take notice of your poverty in one
day, and there was no telling how tactless the first
two had been. At the second meeting of the LAST
OF THE WINNEBAGOS, held on and around
Oh-Pshaw&rsquo;s bed, we formally decided, with much
speechifying by Agony and Oh-Pshaw, that Sally
would be the special object of our Give Service
Pledge. We would make her feel that we didn&rsquo;t
care a rap whether she was poor or not; that it was
she herself we cared about. We would ask her to
share all our good times and would drop in to see
her often, as good neighbors should, and would
finally bring her around to the point where she
would begin to Seek Beauty for herself, see that her
bare room was too ugly for any good use, and gladly
share our overflow with us. Oh, we planned great
things that night!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go over and call on her right away,&rdquo; suggested
Hinpoha, who was fired with enthusiasm at
the plan and couldn&rsquo;t wait to begin the program of
Give Service.</p>
<p>Off we went down the hall, filled with virtuous
enthusiasm. Sally was at home because we could
see the light shining through the transom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, don&rsquo;t knock,&rdquo; whispered Agony
with a giggle. &ldquo;I know a lot more Epic way.&rdquo;
She pulled a candy kiss from her pocket, scribbled
an absurd note on a piece of paper about weary
travelers waiting at the gate, tied it to the kiss and
threw it through the transom.</p>
<p>We heard it strike the floor and heard Sally rise
from a creaking chair and pick it up. Giggling,
we waited for her to come and let us in. In a
minute her footsteps came toward the door and with
comradely smiles we stepped forward. The door
was opened a very small crack, and out flew the
kiss, much faster than it had gone in. It just
missed Hinpoha&rsquo;s nose by a hair&rsquo;s breadth and fell
on the floor with a spiteful thud. Then the door
slammed emphatically. We looked at each other in
consternation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whee-e-e-e-e-!&rdquo; said Agony in a long-drawn
whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrid&mdash;old&mdash;thing!&rdquo; said Hinpoha, picking up
the kiss from the floor and holding it up for us to
see that the note had never been opened. Feeling
both foolish and hurt we trailed back home and
sadly gave up the idea of Giving Service to Sally
Prindle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her alone, she isn&rsquo;t worth worrying about,&rdquo;
said Hinpoha, beginning to be just as cross as she
had been enthusiastic before. &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t a spark
of sociability in her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are Hermit Souls&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Oh-Pshaw,
and Agony cut in with</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Twinkle, twinkle, little Sal,</p>
<p class="t0">How we&rsquo;d like to be your pal,</p>
<p class="t0">But you hold your nose so high</p>
<p class="t0">You don&rsquo;t see us passing by.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>That ended Sally Prindle as far as the LAST OF
THE WINNEBAGOS were concerned. But I had
an uncomfortable feeling all the time that if Nyoda
had been there she would have managed to become
friendly with Sally in some way, and that we had
failed to &ldquo;warm the heart&rdquo; of this &ldquo;lonely mortal&rdquo;
who &ldquo;stood without our open portal.&rdquo; Sally
haunted me. How any girl could live and not be
friendly with the people she saw every day was
more than I could understand. She just grubbed
away at her lessons, paid no attention to what went
on around her, snubbed any girl who tried to make
advances and lived a life of lofty detachment. She
was a good student and invariably recited correctly
when called upon, but beyond that none of the
teachers could get a particle of warmth out of her,
not even fascinating Miss Allison, who has all her
classes worshipping at her feet.</p>
<p>Sally worried me for a while; then she moved
out of Purgatory and took a room with some private
family in town and as I hardly ever saw her
any more I forgot her after a time. Life is so <i>very</i>
full here, Katherine dear, that you can&rsquo;t bother
much about any one person.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>Of course, the big thought that runs through
everything this year, all our work and all our play,
is the War and what we can do to help. At the beginning
of the year Brownell pledged herself to raise
five thousand dollars for the Red Cross by various
activities; this was outside of the personal subscription
fund. A big Christmas bazaar and several
benefit performances brought the total close to
four thousand, but the last thousand proved to be a
sticker. Various committees were called to discuss
ways and means of raising the money, but they
never could agree on anything for the whole college
to do together, and finally abandoned the quest
for a bright idea and decided to let everybody raise
money in any way they could think of and put it
all together to make up the total. The Board of
Trustees offered a silver loving cup to the individual,
club, sorority, group or clique of any kind
that raised the largest amount inside of a month.</p>
<p>The day that was announced there was a hastily
called meeting of the LAST OF THE WINNEBAGOS.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to win that loving cup,&rdquo; declared
Hinpoha in a tone of finality. &ldquo;This is our chance
to show what we&rsquo;re made of. Up until now we&rsquo;ve
been doing little easy &lsquo;Give Services.&rsquo; At last we&rsquo;re
up against something big. Now is the time for
all good men to come to the aid of their party. The
WINNEBAGOS have never fallen down on anything
yet that they undertook and they&rsquo;re not going
to now. We&rsquo;re going to win that contest. Won&rsquo;t
Nyoda be proud of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We cheered until the windows rattled and then
Migwan brought us to earth with a thud. &ldquo;How
are we going to do it?&rdquo; she asked soberly. We all
fell silent and donned our thinking caps. Minutes
passed but nobody sprouted a bright idea. Suggestion
after suggestion was made, only to be turned
down flat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might give a circus,&rdquo; suggested Hinpoha
rather doubtfully. &ldquo;Remember the circus we gave
at home last year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There have been nine circuses of various kinds
already this year,&rdquo; wet-blanketed Agony. &ldquo;You
couldn&rsquo;t hire anybody to attend another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Masquerade as seeresses and give select parlor
readings of people&rsquo;s futures,&rdquo; suggested Oh-Pshaw.
&ldquo;We could charge five dollars for a reading.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Been done already,&rdquo; said Migwan. &ldquo;Anyway,
the faculty have forbidden it. The girls that did it
last year scandalized a prominent Trustee&rsquo;s wife by
telling her that her daughter was going to elope
with an Italian count before the month was out.
The daughter had married a minister the week before,
only the girls didn&rsquo;t know it, and the Trustee&rsquo;s
wife got so excited she sat down on a two-hundred-dollar
Satsuma vase and smashed it and tried to sue
the seeresses for damages. Then, of course, she
found out they were students and the faculty put
an end to parlor seeresses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way it went. Not a plan was suggested
but what turned out to be old stuff or not
practicable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, for an idea!&rdquo; groaned Agony, beating her
white brow with the palm of her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might go round with a hand organ,&rdquo; suggested
Oh-Pshaw in desperation. &ldquo;Gladys could be
the monkey and pass around a tin cup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I wouldn&rsquo;t think of aspiring to such an
honor,&rdquo; I replied modestly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What we want,&rdquo; said Migwan decidedly, &ldquo;is a
fad&mdash;something that will take the college by storm
and separate them from their cash. I remember
last year some of the seniors started the fad of taking
impressions of the palm of your hand on paper
smoked with camphor gum and sending them away
to have the lines read by some noted palmist, and
they made oceans of money at twenty-five cents an
impression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We talked possible fads until we were green in
the face, but nobody got an inspiration and we
finally adjourned with our heads in a whirl.</p>
<p>The next day I went into a deserted classroom
for a book I had left behind and found Sally
Prindle with her head down on one of the desks,
crying. By that time I had forgotten how disagreeable
she had been to us and hastened over to see
what was the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble, Sally?&rdquo; I asked, laying my
hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>Sally started up and tried to wipe the tears away
hastily. &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she answered in a flat voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is too something,&rdquo; I said determinedly,
and sat down on the desk in front of her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>She looked at me sort of defiantly for a minute
and then she broke down altogether. Between sobs
she told me that she wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to
come back to college next year because she hadn&rsquo;t
won the big Andrews prize in mathematics she had
counted confidently on winning, and she had
worked so hard for it that she had neglected her
other work, and the first thing she knew she had
a condition in Latin. Besides, she was sick and
couldn&rsquo;t do the hard work she had been doing outside
to pay her board.</p>
<p>I never saw anyone so broken up over anything.
I wouldn&rsquo;t have expected her to care whether she
came back to college or not; I couldn&rsquo;t see what fun
she had ever gotten out of it, but I suppose in her
own queer way she must have enjoyed it. I tried
to comfort her by telling her that the way would
probably be found somehow if she took it up with
the right people, but Sally wasn&rsquo;t the kind of girl
that took comfort easily. Life was terribly serious
to her. She felt disgraced because she hadn&rsquo;t won
the prize and was sure nobody would want to lend
her money to finish her course. I left her at last
with my heart aching because of the uneven way
things are distributed in this world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>Our room was a mess when I got back. Our
floor was entertaining the floor below that night and
Hinpoha was in the show. She was standing in the
middle of the room draping my dresser scarf around
her shoulders for a fichu, while Agony was piling
her hair high on her head for her and Oh-Pshaw
was pinning on a train made of bath towels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a blue velvet band?&rdquo; Hinpoha demanded
thickly, as I entered, through the pins she
was holding in her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I replied, retiring to a corner
to escape the sweeping strokes of the hair brush in
Agony&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; lamented Hinpoha. &ldquo;I just
<i>have</i> to have one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To put around my neck, of course,&rdquo; explained
Hinpoha impatiently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s absolutely necessary to
finish off this costume. Go out and scrape one up
somewhere, Gladys, there&rsquo;s a dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I obediently made the rounds, but nowhere did
I find the desired blue band. Not even a ribbon of
the right shade was forthcoming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paint one on,&rdquo; suggested Agony, with an inspiration
born of despair. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll surely have
it the right shade.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The paint box is in the bottom dresser drawer,&rdquo;
said Hinpoha, warming to the plan at once. &ldquo;Hurry
up, Agony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll not have time to do it,&rdquo; said Agony,
moving toward the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got just fifteen minutes
left to sew the ruffle back on the bottom of my
white dress to wear in chapel to-morrow when we
sing for the bishop, and it&rsquo;s really more important
for the country&rsquo;s cause that I have a white dress to
wear to-morrow than that you have a blue band
around your neck to-night. My green and purple
plaid silk would look chaste and retiring among the
spotless white of the choir, now, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; And
swinging her hairbrush she went out. Oh-Pshaw
had already disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Gladys,&rdquo; said Hinpoha, holding out the
box to me, &ldquo;mix the turquoise with a little ultramarine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, &rsquo;Poha, but I can&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve an interview with Miss Allison in
five minutes. Get somebody else, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s rushed to death,&rdquo; grumbled Hinpoha.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>I went off to keep my appointment and Hinpoha
took up her watch for a passer-by whom she could
bully into painting a blue band on her neck. Being
part of the surprise for the guests she couldn&rsquo;t very
well go out and risk being seen; she just had to stay
in the room and wait for someone from our floor
to come along. For a long while nobody came,
and then, when she was about ready to give up, she
did hear footsteps coming down the corridor. It
was dark by that time and she couldn&rsquo;t see who it
was, but she pounced out like a cat on a mouse and
dragged the girl into her room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paint a blue band on my neck, quick!&rdquo; she commanded,
thrusting out the paint box and switching
on the light.</p>
<p>Then she saw who it was. It was Sally Prindle.
Hinpoha was a little taken aback, but she had about
exhausted her patience waiting for someone to come
by and help her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you, please?&rdquo; she pleaded, holding out the
paints enticingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Sally dully, looking at Hinpoha
in that crazy costume as if she thought she
was not in her right mind.</p>
<p>Hinpoha explained the urgent and immediate need
of a blue band of a certain shade on her neck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I never painted anything before,&rdquo; objected
Sally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never learn any younger,&rdquo; said Hinpoha,
jubilant that Sally hadn&rsquo;t walked out with her nose
in the air. &ldquo;Here, take the brush, I&rsquo;ll show you
what to mix; see, this and this and this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under Hinpoha&rsquo;s direction Sally painted the blue
band and then regarded her handiwork with critical
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, that&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said Hinpoha, holding out
her hand for the paints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It needs something more,&rdquo; said Sally slowly,
squinting at Hinpoha&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;Do you mind if I
use any more paint?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go as far as you like,&rdquo; said Hinpoha, surprised
into flippancy, &ldquo;let your conscience be your guide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally made swift dabs at the little color squares,
her face all puckered up in a deep frown of concentration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, how do you like it?&rdquo; she asked anxiously,
after a few minutes, leading Hinpoha to the
mirror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>Hinpoha says she screamed right out when she
looked, she was so surprised and delighted. For
on the front of the band Sally had painted the most
wonderful ornament. It was an enormous ruby,
set in a gold frame, the design of which simply
took your breath away. How she ever did it with
the colors in Hinpoha&rsquo;s box is beyond us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, wonderful!&rdquo; raved Hinpoha, hugging Sally
in her extravagant way. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait until the
girls see it. Won&rsquo;t I make a sensation, though!
Come to the party, won&rsquo;t you please, Sally? We&rsquo;d
love to have you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally shook her head and prepared to depart. &ldquo;I
have to go,&rdquo; she said with a return to her old
brusque manner. &ldquo;I have another engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Hinpoha saw the wistful look that came into
her face and she knew that Sally&rsquo;s &ldquo;other engagement&rdquo;
was waiting on table in the boarding house
where she lived.</p>
<p>Hinpoha&rsquo;s painted jewelry created a sensation all
right. Cries of admiration rose on every side, and
the fact that the stony-faced Sally Prindle had
done it only added to the sensation. Who would
ever have suspected that the most inartistic-looking
girl in the whole college had such a talent up her
sleeve?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Two days later there was another excited meeting
of the LAST OF THE WINNEBAGOS.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our fortune&rsquo;s made!&rdquo; shrieked Agony joyfully,
dancing around the room and waving a Japanese
umbrella over her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? How?&rdquo; we all cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fad! The fad!&rdquo; shouted Agony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What fad?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Do stop capering,
Agony, and put down that umbrella before you
break the lamp shade. We&rsquo;ve smashed three already
this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; continued Agony, breathless,
dropping down on the bed and fanning herself with
the handle of the umbrella. &ldquo;Hinpoha&rsquo;s started a
fad with that painted jewelry&mdash;blessings on that
fool notion of hers of painting a band on her neck,
anyway! Half a dozen girls came to classes this
morning with bands painted on their necks and ornaments
in front that they&rsquo;d gotten Sally to paint for
them. In another day the whole college will be
after her to paint ornaments on their necks. Don&rsquo;t
you see what I mean? We&rsquo;ve got to join forces
with Sally, set up in business for the Benefit of
the Red Cross&mdash;and the cup is ours. Whoop-la!
Oh, girls, don&rsquo;t you <i>see</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>We saw, all right. Inside of two minutes Sally
was voted a member of the LAST OF THE WINNEBAGOS
and in a few hours business was in full
swing. Sally, of course, was the star of the cast,
but the rest of us worked just as hard as press
agents. We placarded the whole college with posters
announcing that Mme. Sallie Prindle, the
distinguished painter of jewelry, would create, for
the benefit of the Red Cross, any combination of
precious stones desired by the paintee&mdash;charges
twenty-five cents and up. Students were urged to
show their patriotism by appearing in classroom
adorned with one of the masterpieces of the above-mentioned
Prindle.</p>
<p>It was a success from the word go. The fad
spread like wildfire, and Sally spent all her waking
hours that were not actually taken up with recitations
painting jewelry on fair necks and arms. Lessons
were almost forgotten in the fascinating business
of admiring designs and comparing effects,
and many were the wails because the wonderful
things had to be washed off all too soon. We had
offered our room as studio because Sally&rsquo;s was too
far away from the center of things, and most of the
time it was so crowded with eager customers that
we couldn&rsquo;t get in ourselves. Prices rose as business
increased, and the candy box we were using
for a bank showed signs of collapsing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>The next week the juniors gave a dance and they
all ordered dog collars for the occasion. Everybody
else had to stand aside. Prices for these were
to be one dollar and up, according to how elaborate
they were. How Sally ever got them all on without
fainting in her tracks will always be a mystery.
She did a lot of them the night before and then
the girls wound their necks with gauze bandages
to keep them clean. Miss Allison, who dropped in
during the performance, folded up on the bed and
laughed until she was weak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw anything to equal it, never,&rdquo; she
declared. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s never been such a fad in the
history of the college.&rdquo; Then she sat up and demanded
a dog collar herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why on earth didn&rsquo;t you tell us you could paint
jewelry, Sally Prindle?&rdquo; she asked, as she watched
those swift fingers doing their wonderful work.
&ldquo;Of all things, wasting your time specializing in
mathematical figures, when all the time you had
designs like these in your head!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew I could do it,&rdquo; said Sally in a
funny, bewildered fashion that set the girls all
a-laughing. &ldquo;I never had a paint brush in my hand
before. <i>She</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to Hinpoha&mdash;&ldquo;put the
things into my hands and ordered me to paint, and
I painted. It came to me all of a sudden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did we get the loving cup? I should say we did!
By the end of the month we had raised five hundred
and some odd dollars, more than half of the total,
and by far the largest amount raised by any group.
We were all wrecks by the time it was over, because
we had to take turns waiting on table down at
Sally&rsquo;s boarding house to hold her job for her while
she worked up in our room; besides getting the
paint off the girls&rsquo; necks again. That wasn&rsquo;t always
an easy job because sometimes she had to use
things beside water colors to get certain effects.</p>
<p>But it was well worth our while, for the LAST
OF THE WINNEBAGOS have achieved undying
fame. Migwan started it with her fake Indian
legend and the rest of us surely carried it to a grand
finish. The best of the whole business, though, was
getting Sally.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>Do you know why she was so queer and stand-offish
to people all this while? She told us in a
burst of confidence that night after we had been
given the loving cup. O Katherine, it would almost
break your heart. It seems she has a brother who
forged a note last year and was sent to prison. She
considered that money a debt of honor which she
must pay back, and so she came away to college,
planning to work her way through and become a
teacher of mathematics, which was her strong subject.
But she had taken her brother&rsquo;s disgrace so to
heart that she thought the people in college would
consider her an outcast if they found it out, and,
rather than go through the misery of having people
drop her after they had been friendly with her she
made up her mind to make no friends at all, and
then she didn&rsquo;t need to worry about their finding
it out and cutting her. It broke her all up to turn
down our offers of friendship last fall and she left
Purgatory because she couldn&rsquo;t bear to see us after
that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>Think of it, Katherine, what she must have suffered,
and nobody to tell it to! And everybody
calling her a prune! We all cried over her and
assured her a million times we didn&rsquo;t care a rap
what her brother had done; we loved her and were
proud to have her for a friend. She was a different
girl after that. All the stiffness came out of
her like magic and she looked like a person who has
been let out of prison after being shut up for years.
Her great dread all the time had been that somebody
would find out about her brother; now that
we actually knew it and it didn&rsquo;t make a bit of
difference, the big load was off her spirits. From
being the most unpopular girl in the class she suddenly
became one of the most popular.</p>
<p>All her money troubles faded too, because she got
work making designs for a big Art Craft jewelry
shop that paid her enough so she didn&rsquo;t have to
borrow any more money.</p>
<p>The nicest part of it all, though, was what Agony
did. The night that Sally Prindle told us about
her brother Agony wrote to her father, who, I
imagine, must be a very influential man, and asked
if he could get Sally&rsquo;s brother pardoned. Just how
Agony&rsquo;s father went about it we will never know,
but not long afterward Sally got a letter from her
brother saying that he had been pardoned on the
condition that he would enlist in the army, which
he had done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>Think what that meant to Sally! Instead of being
afraid anyone would find out she had a brother
she could now speak of him as proudly as the other
girls did who had brothers in the army; could take
her place with the proudest of them.</p>
<p>Oh, Katherine, if we could only see right through
people and know just why they do things the way
they do, what a wonderful world this would be!</p>

<h3>KATHERINE TO THE WINNEBAGOS</h3>
<p><span class="date">April 25, 19&mdash;.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Dearest Winnies:</span></p>
<p>I thought it had all happened, that is, everything
that was going to happen for the next ten years,
but it seemed that the excitement of the last few
weeks was but a beginning, and a very humble beginning
at that! We had just gotten over the
sensation of the fire and the arrest of the negro,
and school was in running order again and life in
general had resumed the even tenor of its ways,
when, without warning, the sky fell on the house of
Adams. They say that coming events cast their
shadows before, and that everything works out according
to a fixed rule, but this could only have
been the exception that proved the rule. Having
battered around this wicked world for twenty years
I thought I was prepared for all the shocks that
human flesh is heir to, and that no matter what
happened there was a special rule of etiquette to
fit it, but there was nothing in all my experience,
nor in the Ten Commandments, nor Hoyle, nor
Avogadro&rsquo;s Hypothesis, nor Grimm&rsquo;s Law, that prepared
me for what happened next.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>Saturday was the fateful day. Saturday is the
day on which everything happens to me. I was
born on Saturday; it was on Saturday I met you
and landed headfirst into the Winnebago circus; it
was on Saturday I heard the news that I was not
to go to college, and, I suppose, in the order of
human events, I shall die on Saturday.</p>
<p>On this Saturday morning&mdash;can it be only yesterday?&mdash;I
sat in the doorway peacefully knitting
and occasionally gazing off into space as my
thoughts wandered, flitting from subject to subject
like the yellow butterflies that flashed from flower
to flower. The sunshine sprayed over the roof and
glinted on my amber needles, until it seemed that I
was knitting sunshine right into the socks. I was
filled with a vast contentment that throbbed in my
temples and quivered in my toes; from head to foot
I was &ldquo;in tune with the infinite.&rdquo; That morning
father and I had gone over our accounts and our
balance was so satisfactory that we figured in another
year we could finish paying off the mortgage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>When I complimented father on his talent for
stock farming, he said simply: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all owing to
you. You put new life into us again. We never
could have done it alone. Besides, I reckon most of
the sharp bargaining in horseflesh was done by you.
You got more out of people than I ever did. You&rsquo;ve
kept up the collections, too. You never got
cheated once. You&rsquo;re certainly worth your salt as a
business manager, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Imagine it! Calling me his business manager!
I wasn&rsquo;t an absolute good-for-nothing, then.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>All these things went serenely through my mind
as I sat there knitting in the sunshine, and laying
my plans for summer pleasures. I would take the
Wenonahs and go off camping somewhere in the
woods for a week or two and give them a taste of
real life in the open. The picture of that little camp
rose vividly before me, and I planned out the details
minutely. We would have to have a tent&mdash;somewhere
or other I must acquire this necessary
article. A humorous thought came to me of moving
the schoolhouse out into the woods for a
camper&rsquo;s dwelling, and in imagination I saw it
bumping along behind us on our journey, with Justice
walking along beside it, carrying the chimney
in his arms. I laughed aloud at my incongruous
fancies, startling a hen that was clucking at my
feet so that she fled with a scandalized squawk, stopping
a few yards away to look around at me inquiringly,
as if trying to figure out what was coming
from me next. The hen broke up my fancies
and I returned to my knitting with a start to find I
had dropped several stitches and had a place in the
heel of my sock that looked like the stem end of
an apple. I raveled back and painstakingly re-knitted
the heel, then I laid my knitting in my lap
and gazed dreamily up the road, resting my eyes on
the tender greenness of the fields.</p>
<p>Sitting thus I saw an automobile coming into
view along the road. I watched it idly, glittering
in the sunlight. To my surprise it turned into our
lane and approached the house. I went down to
the drive to meet it; tourists frequently stopped at
the houses for water or for directions, and I would
save these people the trouble of getting out of the
car. The big machine rolled up to the drive and
came to a standstill with a soft sliding of brakes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>Then a loud, hearty voice called out, &ldquo;Why here
she is now! Katherine Adams, don&rsquo;t you know me?
Don&rsquo;t suppose you do, with these infernal glasses
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked hard at the man in the long linen dust
coat and tourist cap who sat alone in the car; then
my eyes nearly popped out of my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Judge Dalrymple!&rdquo; I exclaimed, starting
forward with a cry of joy and seizing the outstretched
hand. &ldquo;Where did you come from? Are
you touring? How did you ever happen to stop
here?&rdquo; I tumbled the questions out thick and fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t &lsquo;happen&rsquo; to stop here,&rdquo; said the Judge
in his decisive way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been rolling over these
endless roads for three days on purpose to get here.
Lord, what a God-forsaken country! And now that
I <i>am</i> here at last,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you going to
ask me in? Where&rsquo;s your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said I, blushing furiously. &ldquo;I was
so taken by surprise at seeing you that I even forgot
my own name, to say nothing of my manners.
Come right in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>I settled him in the best chair in the house,
brought him a glass of water and left him talking to
mother in his hearty way while I went out in search
of father. Father was painting a shed when I
found him, and he came just the way he was, with
streaks of paint on his jumper and overalls. If
he had had any inkling of what he was being summoned
to&mdash;&mdash;!</p>
<p>Judge Dalrymple was just as pleased to meet
father in his paint-streaked jumper as if he had been
a senator in a silk hat, and after the first moment
of embarrassment father felt as if the Judge were
an old-time friend.</p>
<p>Then the Judge began to explain why he had
come, and the bomb dropped on the roof of the
house of Adams. I couldn&rsquo;t comprehend it at first
any more than father could. It sounded like a
page out of Grimm&rsquo;s Fairy Tales. But it seemed
that he knew all about the company my father had
lost his money in last summer, and he and some
other men bought it up and set it on its feet again.
War orders had suddenly boomed it and it was now
solid as a rock. The original stockholders still held
their shares and would draw their dividends as soon
as they were declared, which Judge Dalrymple
prophesied would be soon. Our days of struggling
were over. We were &ldquo;hard-uppers&rdquo; no longer; we
were &ldquo;well off&rdquo; at last. I left the Judge and father
talking over the details of the business and wandered
aimlessly around the dooryard, trying to comprehend
the meaning of what had happened to us,
and capering as each new thing occurred to me. My
narrow horizon had suddenly rolled back and the
whole world lay before me. College&mdash;travel&mdash;study&mdash;return
to my beloved friends in the east&mdash;best
doctors for mother&mdash;all those things kaleidoscoped
before me, leaving me giddy and faint. I seized a
hoe and began to demolish an ant hill for sheer
exuberance of spirits.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, have you had a sunstroke?&rdquo;
asked Justice Sherman, suddenly appearing beside
me from somewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse than that, it&rsquo;s an earthquake,&rdquo; I replied.
&ldquo;Take a deep breath, Justice Sherman, because
you&rsquo;re going to need it in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I told him about father&rsquo;s investing his
money in the western oil company last summer and
apparently losing it, and how the company had unexpectedly
come to life again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; said Justice, looking dazed for a minute;
then he expressed the sincerest joy at our good
fortune I have ever heard one mortal express at
the prosperity of another. But after his congratulations
were all made he stopped short as if he had
just thought of something and then he said slowly,
&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll be going away from here now;
moving out west, possibly to San Francisco?&rdquo; It
seemed to me that he looked very sober at the
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I know it,&rdquo; I replied decisively. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll
be the east for me, if I go anywhere, where the
Winnebagos have their hunting grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> going away then?&rdquo; asked Justice composedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I replied truthfully. &ldquo;Nothing is
settled yet. Give us time to catch our breath. In
the meantime, come in and meet our guest, the new
president of the Pacific Refining Company, who
came to tell us the good news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Justice assumed an exaggerated air of dignity
and formality that upset my composure so I could
hardly keep my face straight as I walked into the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Judge,&rdquo; I called blithely, &ldquo;here is the rest
of the happy family. Justice, this is Judge Dalrymple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the second bomb dropped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>For, at the sight of Justice, Judge Dalrymple
sprang out of his chair with a hoarse sound in his
throat as if he were choking, and stood staring at
him as if he had seen a ghost. Justice looked fit to
drop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; he said weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Justice!&rdquo; said Judge Dalrymple with dry lips.
&ldquo;How did you get here? Where have you been all
this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out west,&rdquo; replied Justice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell us where you were??&rdquo; asked
the Judge, sitting down heavily again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I merely followed your instructions,&rdquo; replied
Justice with dignity. &ldquo;You told me to get out; that
you didn&rsquo;t ever want to hear from me again, and I
took you at your word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a fool, a blind fool, and in a great rage
when I said that. I didn&rsquo;t mean it,&rdquo; said the Judge,
in a choking voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said it, nevertheless,&rdquo; replied Justice,
&ldquo;and I was hot-headed and went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you been doing all this time?&rdquo; asked
the Judge curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roughing it,&rdquo; replied Justice, in the tone of one
who has great adventures to tell, &ldquo;until I came here
and turned into a professor.&rdquo; A humorous twinkle
lit up his eye as he mentioned the word &ldquo;Professor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>In a daze of astonishment father, mother and I
watched this unexpected meeting and reconciliation
between father and son. In due time we had all
the story. Judge Dalrymple had set his heart on
having his oldest son, Justice, become a lawyer like
himself, and go into his law firm as junior partner.
But Justice had no liking for the law. All he
wanted to do was tinker with electrical things. It
was the only thing in the world he cared for. When
he got through college and his father insisted upon
his entering the law school he flatly refused. There
was a scene and he and his father quarreled bitterly.
His father told him he could either go to law
school or get out and hoe for himself and he chose
the latter. He left home. All the while he had
been in college he had been working on an electrical
device to enable deaf men to receive wireless
messages. He now went to work on this and finished
it, and, boylike, thought his fortune was made.
But it seemed fortune had turned her back on him.
He had no money himself to market the device and
he could not succeed in interesting anyone with capital.
He spent many weary days, going from one
place to another with his invention, only to meet
with failure on all sides. He had always had delicate
health and the long hours he had spent indoors
working on his beloved experiments finally told on
him and he developed a throat trouble which made
it impossible for him to stay in the north. One
day, in a moment of great discouragement, he threw
his invention into the New York harbor and sorrowfully
gave up his dream of being an inventor.
He was down and out but still too proud to write
home and ask help from his father. He had a
chance to act as chauffeur for a party of ladies who
wanted to tour the west and in this manner he made
his way to Texas. He worked there on a sheep
ranch for a number of months; then, seized with a
desire to see the country, he worked his way through
the Territory and into Arkansas, and finally into
the township of Spencer, where he was attacked by
robbers one night on the road, robbed of all his
belongings and left lying there with his head cut
open. Then it was that he had wandered into our
stable, was found, and nursed back to health.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>Our climate agreed with him so well that he decided
to stay for a while, and got the position of
teaching in the high school at Spencer, which wasn&rsquo;t
very hard work. The long walk or drive in the
open, back and forth every day, and his sleeping
in the airy shack, gradually worked a cure to his
throat, and brought back the health he had lost
through overwork and disappointment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>Besides&mdash;just listen to this, will you&mdash;he said
that I had given him such an amazing new outlook
on life that he wanted to stay as near to me as he
could and learn my philosophy. He had been
utterly discouraged when he came, had lost his grip
on things, and didn&rsquo;t care a hang what became of
him, but I had put new life and ambition back
into him. Imagine it! My philosophy!</p>
<p>He had resolved to have nothing more to do with
his father after he had turned him out, and dropped
the name of Dalrymple, going by the name of Justice
Sherman. His full name was Justice Sherman
Dalrymple.</p>
<p>Thus ended the mystery of the scholarly sheep
herder. The son of <i>my</i> Judge Dalrymple! I
couldn&rsquo;t believe it, but it was true beyond a doubt.
I <i>did</i> know a hawk from a handsaw, after all. No
wonder he had looked so sad sometimes when he
thought no one was watching him, with such memories
to brood over! No wonder he had acted so
queerly when I told him what we had done to
Antha and Anthony up on Ellen&rsquo;s Isle. They were
his younger brother and sister!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>Judge Dalrymple was speaking to Sherman again.
&ldquo;So you threw your invention into the New York
Harbor, did you?&rdquo; he said regretfully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too
bad, because some one to whom you showed it has
been writing and writing to the house about it. I
couldn&rsquo;t forward the letter because I had no idea
where you were. The Government wants to try
out your invention. I never dreamed that those
fool experiments you were forever making amounted
to anything. I see now you were wiser than I.
Come home, boy, and tinker all you like. We&rsquo;ll
throw the lawyer business into the discard. Could
you build up your thingummyjig again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this astonishing news Justice began whooping
like a wild Indian. &ldquo;Could I build it up again?&rdquo; he
shouted. &ldquo;Just give me a chance. Just watch me!&rdquo;
He seized me around the waist and began jigging
with me all over the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save the pieces,&rdquo; I panted, sinking into a chair
and making a vain attempt to smooth back my flying
hair.</p>
<p>Then I noticed that Judge Dalrymple was looking
at me with eyes filled with awe, not to say fear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Girl, what are you?&rdquo; he asked in a strange voice.
&ldquo;Are you Fate? Every time I come in touch with
you, you work some miracle in my household. First
you perform a magic in my two younger children,
and then when I attempt to make some slight return
for your great service and seek you out, I find that
you have also drawn my other child to you from out
of the Vast and worked as great a miracle in him.
Are you human or superhuman, that you can play
with people&rsquo;s destinies like that? Under what star
were you born, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t any stars at all,&rdquo; I replied, laughing.
&ldquo;The sun was shining!&rdquo;</p>
<p>O my Winnies, what a day this has been! The
sun rose exactly as on any other day, without any
warning of what was coming, and yet before he set
the world had been turned topsy turvy for five people!
Isn&rsquo;t life glorious, though? Mercy, but I&rsquo;m
glad I was born!</p>

<h3>KATHERINE TO THE WINNEBAGOS</h3>
<p><span class="date">April 27, 19&mdash;.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Oh, My Winnies:</span></p>
<p>How can I tell it? Father died to-day. Heart
failure, brought on by excitement over the fire and
the coming of Judge Dalrymple. Think of it!
After all these years of hard work and grinding
poverty and bitter disappointment, to fall just at the
moment when success and prosperity were within
reach. Oh, the terrible irony of Life!</p>
<p><span class="center">Your broken-hearted</span>

<h3>KATHERINE TO THE WINNEBAGOS</h3>
<p><span class="date">May 9, 19&mdash;.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Dearest Winnies:</span></p>
<p>Thanks, a thousand times, for all the beautiful,
comforting letters you wrote. When did anyone
ever have such friends as I? Everyone has been so
kind, so sympathetic. The whole countryside turned
out to help us. Judge Dalrymple and Justice are
still here, straightening up father&rsquo;s affairs. The
farm and the stock are to be sold. Mother is sick;
father&rsquo;s death was a great shock to her. As soon
as she is better she and I are going home with Judge
Dalrymple for a visit. We are going to motor back
with him and Justice&mdash;won&rsquo;t it be glorious? Justice
is going back home to live. He and his father have
become great pals; it is perfect joy to watch them
going about like two boys, arm in arm. You never
see one without the other any more. Now that they
are together it is possible to see quite a resemblance,
but Justice is much handsomer than his father ever
could have been. Sandhelo acted just as though he
remembered the Judge from last summer; he
squealed when he saw him and put his nose into his
pocket. We had a council about what should become
of Sandhelo and finally decided that he was to
be sent home to Judge Dalrymple&rsquo;s to be a pet for
Antha and Anthony. Sandhelo nodded solemnly
when we told him, as much as to say it was all right
with him. I have a queer feeling all the time that
that mule is more than half human. He has such
an uncanny way of taking people&rsquo;s affairs into his
own hands, sometimes. Did he not recognize Justice
in the road that night when I would have fled
from him, thinking he was the negro, Solomon, and
didn&rsquo;t he scare Solomon into confessing that he had
set fire to Elijah Butts&rsquo; cotton storehouse?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>To-morrow is May 10th, the date that school
closes in this district, and I have planned a farewell
celebration for the scholars. I am going
to give them &ldquo;for keeps&rdquo; all the things that came
from the House of the Open Door, besides all the
splendid things that came for Christmas, to be the
property of the Corners schoolhouse from that time
on henceforward, to make of it another House of
the Open Door.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">May 10th, Evening.</span></p>
<p>Another amazing day! Do you know, I half believe
that I have been transported in a dream back
to the land of witches and fairies, and have to keep
pinching myself to make sure I&rsquo;m still myself, Katherine
Adams, and not some other girl who has gotten
into my shoes by mistake. I have a dreadful
fear that I will find my real self sitting in the road
somewhere, tumbled off old Major&rsquo;s back as he
ambled along, reading in some book of romance the
wonderful things that are happening to this new,
strange self. And presently it will be time to go
home and help with supper, and romance will come
to an end with the closing of the book.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>But I guess I&rsquo;m real, all right. Before the door
stands Judge Dalrymple&rsquo;s car, latest model; its loud,
raucous voice containing no hint of elfin horns as it
announces the return of Justice and his father from
a spin in the country. Beside me on the table is the
deed of sale of our property, made out to one Jim
Wiggin, and drawn up on very substantial-looking
paper; and on my wrist sparkles the beautiful little
gold watch which is a very tangible souvenir of this
last amazing day. It ticks away companionably, as
if to reassure me of its realness. I have named it
Thomas Tickle, and we are going to be inseparable
friends.</p>
<p>You remember I told you I had planned a little
last-day-of-school celebration for the scholars?
Well!!! As it turned out, it made the Pageant look
like five cents&rsquo; worth of laundry soap by comparison.
When I got to school in the morning I found
the schoolhouse draped with flags and bunting, inside
and outside, and my desk piled a foot high with
great red roses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>Then the people began to arrive. It seemed the
whole county was there. My eyes began to pop out
of my head as one after another of the celebrities
began to arrive. The School Board from Spencer
came <i>en phalanx</i>, and in marching order behind
them came the high school pupils with Justice at
their head. The parents of the pupils were all there
in state and it soon became evident that we would
have to hold our closing exercises outdoors, as the
schoolhouse would not hold one-tenth of the crowd.</p>
<p>I was rushing around like a fire engine with the
steering gear gone, trying to find things for various
mothers to sit on, when I was conscious of a solemn
hush, and with a flourish the county school
commissioners drove up and with them came Miss
Fairlee, the Commission Lady.</p>
<p>Then there broke loose a sound of revelry by day.
My scholars did the folk dances and gave the little
play I taught them; the Camp Fire Girls held a ceremonial
meeting and gave demonstrations of poncho
rolling, camp cooking, etc., while the boys had an
exhibition of the articles they had made from wood,
out of the Dan Beard book.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>Then in a speech, which was more earnest than
eloquent, I gave to the school the furnishings from
the House of the Open Door, together with the
graphophone, the lantern and the slides, to have and
to hold, to be the foundation of a new House of the
Open Door. There was tumultuous applause, and I
sat down, red and perspiring, and my part of the
show was over.</p>
<p>Thereupon, up rose Absalom Butts, punched in
the back as I could see by three or four of the other
boys, and, swallowing his fourteen-year-old embarrassment
as well as he could, he thrust into my hands
a little blue velvet case, mumbling the while, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
yours. From the school. In token of our&mdash;of
our&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here he forgot his speech, looked around wildly,
and then burst out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re givin&rsquo; it to you because you showed us
such a good time, and we&rsquo;re sorry you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;
away!&rdquo; Then he fled to his place and hid his blushes
behind Henry Smoot&rsquo;s red head.</p>
<p>I opened the case and took out a dear little gold
wrist watch. I started to thank them, but choked
utterly when I thought of the sacrifices it must have
cost some of those people to help buy that watch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>But this was no time for tears. The main dish
of the feast was being brought in. The chief of
the County school commissioners, the guest of
honor, rose pompously and made his way to the
front after being ceremoniously introduced by
Elijah Butts. After much clearing of the throat he
began a flowery speech about the fame that had
been gained throughout the county by the little
schoolhouse at our Corners on account of its Red
Cross activities and Patriotic Pageants; how it had
been made the social center for the people all around
and had helped educate them to better things; how
the boys and girls had learned more useful things
from me than from anyone else who had ever taught
there; and how Miss Fairlee, who had come from
the East to study rural school conditions in our section
had been quite carried away with my work, and
so on, <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>
<p>Then, having loaded his cannon very carefully,
so to speak, he proceeded to fire it into the crowd
with telling effect. The County school commissioners,
he announced with a fine air of jocularity, had
heard that I was carrying the schoolhouse around
with me wherever I went, and as they were afraid
it might get mislaid some day they had voted to
build a new brick schoolhouse on a foundation; one
that couldn&rsquo;t be moved. A new schoolhouse for
our district! Nobody had ever dared hope for such
a thing, not even in their wildest dreams. And it
seems that I had precipitated all this good fortune!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>Later on I happened to hear this same commissioner
congratulating Elijah Butts on the good
teacher he had picked, and Elijah swelled up like a
pouter pigeon and replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I spotted her for a good one the minute
I laid eyes on her. It was me that persuaded the
Board to hire her when some of them was holdin&rsquo;
back, favorin&rsquo; a different kind of female. Yessir,
it was me that picked her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Justice, who had also overheard the conversation,
winked solemnly and we both fled where we could
have our laugh out unnoticed.</p>
<p>But the best part of it all came after the Big
Show was over. Miss Fairlee came up and took me
by the arm and strolled away with me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;would you consider leaving
this place and coming East with me? I need an assistant
in my Social Settlement work for the summer,
and there&rsquo;s no one I&rsquo;ve met in the whole country
that would fill the bill as well as you. For handling
difficult situations you are a perfect marvel.
Your talents are wasted out here&mdash;anyone can carry
on the work that you have started so wonderfully.
Won&rsquo;t you please come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We talked about it a bit, and where do you suppose
this Social Settlement is? Where but in the
one spot on earth that I&rsquo;d rather be than any other!
The same city, my dears, that has the honor of being
your home! It&rsquo;s all settled now, and I am to go,
after my visit to the Dalrymples. Mother is going
into a big Sanitarium, and I am going to work with
Miss Fairlee through the summer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>Clear the track! The Winnebago Special is about
to start once more! O my Winnies, don&rsquo;t you see
the miracle of it all? Here I was, pining to live in
a House by the Side of the Road, when all the time
I <i>was</i> living in a House by the Side of the Road! It
was my little despised schoolhouse. I was sent here
by fate to prove myself worthy or unworthy of
what she had in store for me. I was taken away
from you that I might come back to a richer, fuller
life than I had dreamed of in the old days. It is
all part of a Plan, so big and wonderful that I lose
my breath when I think of it. But whatever the
Plan may turn out to be in the future, there&rsquo;s only
one thing about it that interests me now, and that
is, I&rsquo;m coming back to you. I&rsquo;m coming back!
Back to my Winnies! Hang out the latchstring and
remove everything breakable, for the wanderer is
coming home!</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
